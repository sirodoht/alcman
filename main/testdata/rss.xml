            <title>There is nothing that she hates more than wasting her time</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/there-is-nothing-that-she-hates-more-than-wasting-her-time/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;There is nothing that she hates more than “wasting her time”.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Of course, for me, any second spent with her is the farthest thing from waste. But, in my book,
                time waste is impossible in general. It has been impossible since I realised what the content of life
                is. Or maybe what it isn’t. It isn’t to produce as much as possible. Yet, the argument of having control
                over one’s time, I do consider very valid.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;What annoys me is waste in the context of capitalistic production. Time not creating, learning,
                self-improving in any way, she considers “waste”. How annoying. But just like &lt;a
                href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/267314-you-don-t-love-because-you-love-despite-not-for-the"&gt;they
                say&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;you love someone despite the faults, not because of the
                virtues&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Well, I do love her &lt;strong&gt;despite&lt;/strong&gt; her production-focused mindset. But I
                also do love her &lt;strong&gt;because&lt;/strong&gt; of her determination (among other
                things).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this determination is the other side of the same coin. It is the key skill one
                needs in order to be productive and capitalistically successful. This confirms that other saying:
                &lt;em&gt;someone’s best feature is also their worst&lt;/em&gt;. This feature is her determination,
                which leads to both being into nonstop production (the “worst feature”) as well as being intelligent and
                creative (the “best feature”).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Film: Everything Everywhere All at Once</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/film-everything-everywhere-all-at-once/</link>
            <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Caution, full of spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Everything Everywhere All at Once is a brilliant, genius depiction of post-modern life, in a
                post-modern way.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We have all the answers to our problems, we know we do. They are what the movie says. It’s
                love. It’s ignoring everything except one thing. It’s tackling depression (the bagel). It’s resisting
                fighting because we’re confused.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We live everything, through the non-stop internet. We live everywhere, through teleportation
                aka flying. It’s all at once—it is. This movie is our life, just through another lens. One through
                multiverses. Why? Because we can only understand through technology; through hard facts, and our current
                theory of everything is string theory, multiverses, quantum superposition, et cetera—so that’s the only
                way we can be convinced of love being the point of life.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This meta almost masterpiece is written by two guys. I was puzzled when I found that out as the
                core relationship of the film is between a mother and her daughter. The protagonists of this 2020s
                version of Matrix are female, of course, as the modern background—the antithesis to the world’s
                patriarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;“Then I will cherish these few specks of time”&lt;br&gt;
                – Evelyn to her daughter, Joy, just as she’s suiciding&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Not only is the above line a depiction of depression (everything is black, sometimes yes we
                might have fun. but everything really is black) but also a depiction of eros. Not love, not this
                umbrella word describing a generic feeling. But eros, &lt;em&gt;being in love&lt;/em&gt;, which is total
                agony (aka blackness) while raving for the moments when you’re together with your erotical counterpart.
                Just like stars. Specks of light, amidst the black blackness.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;While all that, EEAAO is keeping our short attention span with radical creativity (hot dog
                finger people, genius) and pop culture (raccacoonie, pure genius again).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The husband’s key fighting technique, kindness, is only the beginning of the movie’s thesis.
                Like another Jesus (and Socrates) he says “be kind! especially when we don’t know what the fuck is going
                on—which is always the case, even when we’re pretending we know who we are”. Evelyn, the mom, is
                convinced—she’s been in love in the past and can remember not only feeling different in that present,
                but also feeling amazing for that future. She knows this can happen.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Joy, the daughter, who in reality is the lack of joy, hasn’t. She’s the average western
                teenager, especially from the US where all other teenagers are happy and rich while you’re not. There
                never was a good outlook for her life. She only knows her mother’s intense negativity as a response to
                what’s life throwing at them—and her father’s naive kind-heartedness. That’s her thesis she wants to be
                an antithesis to—and she does that by pushing her limits in the Alpha universe and by getting away from
                her parents on the IRS-enabled one.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But she fails. She fails everywhere and at everything—that’s the nature of the true blackness
                of depression. She’s not convinced by her father’s proposition (which is “I choose to see the bring
                side—please choose too”) at all. So now, the omnipotent mother will &lt;em&gt;show&lt;/em&gt; her her
                love everywhere, with everything, and all at once. Even when she’s actually the IRS agent as her husband
                in the hot dog finger universe where they cum cheese.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;That’s where the pinkfloydian wall finally breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;“So, what? You’re just gonna ignore everything else? You could be anything,
                anywhere.”&lt;br&gt;
                – Joy to her mother, Evelyn&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But it’s negativity that’s giving us the frame whereas now everything is positive (“you could
                be anything! anywhere!”).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;“Why would I want to be anything, anywhere, if there is no lack of it, needed to paint the
                outline (and meaning!) of my doing?”&lt;br&gt;
                – Evelyn, in the parallel universe that she has read Hegel&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I would almost love this movie—well, I did—although:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;“We can do whatever we want. Nothing matters.”&lt;br&gt;
                – Evelyn, just as she reconciles the paradox of life&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The optimistic nihilism is, yes, indeed, the point—yet can we resist the temptation when we
                don’t have the clarity of the superposition of depression’s thesis and antithesis? I’m not
                sure.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Smart people of the past weren’t sure either—that’s why they had &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt;
                that it is like that. They had &lt;em&gt;faith&lt;/em&gt; in a God that told them that there is a point
                to all this, especially when life is not fun. We have no God so…&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;So, I wonder, what happens when the IRS agent makes Evelyn’s life too hard? It’s not going to
                be a walk in the park from now on, right? She still has to live her life with all the sufferings. But
                now she has the power to jump into another universe, so why not jump? If this universe is too hard?
                Maybe it’s ok?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We all know what happens then—she gets lost in the multiverse chaos. Maybe she wouldn’t because
                she has gained universal enlightenment and can fight the urge off (although we do see her mind wander
                right at the very end) but what about me, dear reader, when that movie gets slowly forgotten—how do I
                remain optimistic with nihilism?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Should I just watch this movie again? What if I create a symbol to represent this movie in my
                mind and just think of that? Say, this symbol is the word “hotdog”. I wouldn’t need to go through the
                process of seeing and feeling this movie again, I could be reminded of it with just “hotdog”!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But what if instead of “hotdog” this word is “god”?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Phoebe can’t swear</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/phoebe-cant-swear/</link>
            <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Ted Lasso Season 2 — SPOILERS AHEAD&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In Ted Lasso (season 2, episode 8) Phoebe, Roy Kent’s niece, is expelled from school because
                she swears.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Roy swears incessantly. Her teacher swears, Keelly swears, Rebecca swears. Everyone swears, not
                just her micro-bubble—everyone in the Ted Lasso universe (as a reflection of our real world society)
                swears.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Yet Phoebe, an 8 year old girl, along all the other girls and some of the boys, cannot—as in:
                strictly prohibited—swear.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I started wanting to make the claim that this is unfair. Yet the only rudimentary sensible
                claim I can make is ask:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Why do we think this is going to work?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But as I’m writing these words, I realise, something even crazier happens: it does
                work.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Kids grow up in a society that everybody swears all the time. On TV, on the internet, at
                school, inside the house, outside the house, at the park, at the shops. Yet they are taught that they
                cannot swear themselves—until they achieve adulthood. At that point, not only can they start but are
                also expected to swear—as well as: deter (as &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; were detered) non-adults from
                swearing.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;How can this seemingly mad cycle be sustainable?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If the facts don’t fit the theory, change the facts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It’s not a mad cycle. It’s a perfectly reasonable one. Kids are taught that kids cannot swear
                and this is exactly what they learn. They start swearing when they are no longer kids and when it’s
                their turn as adults, they teach exactly what they learned. Perfectly reasonable memetic model, in
                accordance with everything else humans do.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Such is the way, I realise, my argument should be about justice after all.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;All humans equal before swearing.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>State-as-a-Service</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/state-as-a-service/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;In our Western societies state is expected to be a State-as-a-service.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;People expect to pay taxes—just as they pay for a service, eg. Dropbox—and then enjoy the
                benefits. These are nice neighbourhoods, public transport, high quality public schools, free healthcare,
                et al. Everything with no complicated administrative processes or bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The important bit, here, is that citizens don’t care about how all these will be implemented.
                They are not interested in the process with which these will be achieved. They pay taxes, so they expect
                it to happen—the end.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="state-as-a-service-is-the-future"&gt;State-as-a-Service is the future&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;State as a service sounds like the future. In the future, people don’t have to think about how
                they will have good city transportation, or high quality public education, or free healthcare. They will
                just have it. All these will just exist. The questions on how to build them will be abstracted away as
                solved problems.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Because they are. We have witnessed some cities with high quality public transport and some
                countries with great free healthcare and some public schools which are extraordinary. We know it can be
                done; the way they did it is not a secret, so there should be no problem having it everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But as we all know from experience, this is not the case. It’s actually extremely hard to copy
                any high quality elements of a state. This is the reason that I will also argue for the opposite of a
                State-as-a-Service, which I will call self-hosted states.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="self-hosted-software-and-states"&gt;Self-hosted software and states&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;These two concepts, state-as-a-service and self-hosted states, are inspired from the software
                industry. In the era of the internet, we have software services and these can exist either as a service
                or self-hosted.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As-a-service software is when the code is running in some company’s server, somewhere on the
                internet. We don’t have control over that part. What we can control is what the software creator has
                allowed us to control through the website or app of this software. This is the most common kind of
                software that people use, by far. Facebook, Gmail, eBay, DALL·E are all provided in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, self-hosted services are when the code is running on a machine that we
                control. It’s mostly technical people who interact with software services in this way, though, the
                reason being the need for technical knowledge to set it up. Even then, though, the vast majority of
                technical people avoid self-hosted services because of the time and effort required to set them
                up.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;For example, for myself, maybe I don’t trust any big company to hold my photos, so I have set
                up &lt;a href="https://photoprism.app/"&gt;Photoprism&lt;/a&gt; on a server that I own and I store my
                photos there. Since Photoprism supports album sharing, I can give access to group photos to my friends
                as well. Photoprism, being self-hosted software, gives me much higher confidence&lt;sup
                id="fnref:hacked"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:hacked"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that my
                photos have not been used by companies for advertisement purposes or ML models. However, I need to spend
                some hours per month to maintain the server and the software. This includes updating the operating
                system, applying security updates that handle potentially newly discovered holes, and even getting the
                new features that photoprism releases now and then.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Many technical people do not want to go into this effort. Simply put, the benefits do not
                outweigh the drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In an analogous way, people are not interested in spending their time deciding how the state’s
                budget allocation will go so that we enjoy universal free healthcare. Of course, benefits on a state
                level is not the sole analogy. On a more local level, we could spend time figuring out how to improve
                our neighbourhood or support rough sleepers in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="space-for-both"&gt;Space for both&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I claim: we can accomondate both kinds. Some people want to get into policy decisions, present
                pros and cons, research alternative potential solution, create budgets. Others really don’t care about
                any of these; they just want to enjoy life.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The current system does not allow people who care about these to actualise their interest. One
                cannot just become a politician. They also have to make a living—unless one can make a living by being a
                politician. I think most can agree that this process is hardly attainable for the vast majority of
                people.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="epilogue"&gt;Epilogue&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Admittedly, the benefits of state-as-a-service are awesome. If only we had them without the
                drawbacks. However, I’m a proponent of giving the option of self-hosted software because some people
                really are paranoid and neurodivergence is not only allowed but maybe also desired.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

            <title>Should we celebrate acquisitions?</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/should-we-celebrate-acquisitions/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite companies &lt;a
                href="https://postmarkapp.com/blog/postmark-and-dmarc-digests-acquired-by-activecampaign"&gt;got
                acquired&lt;/a&gt;. I’m always trying to figure out if I want to be happy when a company gets
                acquired.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It’s usually acquired by a much bigger company. Founders and investors make a lot of money.
                Everyone looks ecstatic and everyone congratulates everyone else. But why?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Why should we be happy they got acquired? Presumably, because of the money they made.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley’s imaginary is based on that we improve the world with software and technology.
                Money is irrelevant. What matters is to advance as society.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It’s been a while since I started viewing the process of building a company as providing a
                service. Not as in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_(systems_architecture)"&gt;system
                service&lt;/a&gt; but as in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_service"&gt;community
                service&lt;/a&gt;. Someone who creates a company is someone going out of their way to help people. In
                return for the product/service provided, these people pay money. Both to keep providing it and as a
                thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;So, when this model ends, I think it’s a sad day. People who really cared about something and
                dedicated themselves to it, stopped. Maybe they got tired. It’s ok to get tired. But probably not a
                cause for celebration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Open source movement as societal theory</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/open-source-movement-as-societal-theory/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently came across the &lt;a href="https://openinsulin.org/"&gt;Open Insulin
                Foundation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We’re a team of biohackers with a variety of backgrounds, and skills, and relationships to
                insulin and diabetes from [...] around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We’re working to develop the first practical, small-scale, community-centered model for insulin
                production to make insulin accessible to all. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;and:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We envision a world [...] where people living with diabetes and their communities can own and
                govern the organizations that produce the medicine they depend on to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The problem is &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_(medication)#Economics"&gt;well-known&lt;/a&gt; to the
                Western world. Pharmaceutical companies are taking advantage of the US citizens. All of them through
                taxes. Some of them more directly through having to pay high prices for a cheap drug, insulin, which is
                literally vital to their livelihood.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The people of the Open Insulin Foundation want to solve this problem by the most direct and
                effective solution they can think of: teach everybody who needs it how to create it—full stop.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Somebody commented:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t it be easier to lobby the Congress to fix the laws?&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27854270"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(not
                verbatim)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The US Congress is probably aware of the issue. The Open Insulin Foundation is direct action.
                It reminds me of something else.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="open-source-movement"&gt;Open source movement&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I think the open source software movement is like this.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In 2003, somebody thought it’d be a good idea to write software for a newspaper website using
                Python. Then, they gave it to the world, for everyone to use it and solve the same problem they
                faced—for free. Not only that but there is a good amount of people who keeps improving it (now, 20 years
                later) without immediate reward. I’m talking about the &lt;a
                href="https://www.djangoproject.com/"&gt;Django web framework&lt;/a&gt; here, just one among the
                countless open source projects which serve as the bedrock of the modern software industry.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;All of these projects, as part of the open source software movement, work in a &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy"&gt;gift economy&lt;/a&gt;. Their creators don’t expect
                anything. They just build, maintain, improve—rarely asking for rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="why"&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I can see (at least) two potential motivators. One: they are happy to help. If they have
                already solved a problem, why not release the code so that someone else can find the solution instead of
                someone having to solve it again?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Two: they believe in the open source movement. Politically paraphrasing: they believe in the
                power of the gift economy. When I was starting to learn coding the open source movement wasn’t as big as
                today. All I wanted was to find some code to read, copy, understand how it works, and change it, for my
                own ideas to materialise. Turns out copying code is not legal—unless it’s an open source piece of
                software&lt;sup id="fnref:licenses"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref"
                href="#fn:licenses"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Open source software was the most exciting thing for me back then because it meant that I can
                read it, understand it, change it. This is the gift I received and this is the gift I want to give back
                now that it’s my turn. I think a large percentage of the open source movement shares this kind of
                motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In addition to this simple “give back” mentality, many also believe in the movement in a more
                political way. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement"&gt;Free
                software&lt;/a&gt; is similar but &lt;a
                href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.en.html"&gt;not exactly the
                same&lt;/a&gt; as open source.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="impact"&gt;Impact&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It’s important to clarify, here, the range to which the free and open source software movement
                extends. Anyone (however inexperienced) can release a project as open source&lt;sup
                id="fnref:freesoftware"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:freesoftware"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
                but this doesn’t mean that there isn’t an abundance of world-class open source projects. Django, as the
                example already mentioned, is widely successful and used by lots of companies the average non-programmer
                Western citizen knows, eg. Instagram, Spotify, NASA, et al.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To reiterate more clearly: all of these companies (and practically all internet companies)
                use—not just as a nice supplement but—as part of their most essential and critical infrastructure
                software that was made in the past and released for free and for anyone to use.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;For example, Instagram, as one of the most extreme examples, makes billions using Django. Yet
                the people who created Django have not received much from them&lt;sup id="fnref:dsf"&gt;&lt;a
                class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:dsf"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I am not interested in presenting this
                as unfair. The Django authors shared their creation for others to use without any expectations—as a
                gift! My claim is that we should admire their eminence and maturity. It’s a true ethical
                achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="applying-it-to-society"&gt;Applying it to society&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Open Insulin Foundation applies this philosophy (of the gift economy) to the
                non-programming crowd and specifically to the healthcare industry. They face the problem head-on and
                fight fiercely to solve it with no fanfare, only essence.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;We need insulin.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Let’s make it for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ol&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;There’s nothing more to it.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This might make us ponder: can we apply this thinking to more things in our societies? Can we
                make food for everyone and be done with this issue? Can we make houses for everyone and end the constant
                stress and misery?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It feels like this is a nice&lt;sup id="fnref:disagree"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref"
                href="#fn:disagree"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; first answer to the &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_is_no_alternative"&gt;ever recurring question&lt;/a&gt;: if
                not capitalism, then what?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Maybe gift economy.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
                &lt;hr&gt;
                &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:licenses"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is not exactly true, either, though. There is a &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licences"&gt;wide array
                of licenses&lt;/a&gt; that define more specifically what one can and cannot do with some
                code.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:licenses" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in
                the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:dsf"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;At least I couldn’t find any indication that they have. One can see the corporate members of
                the Django Software Foundation &lt;a
                href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/corporate-members/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a
                class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:dsf" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the
                text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:freesoftware"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;And/or free software.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:freesoftware"
                title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:disagree"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In reality, it’s a “nice” answer only for me and very few others. Not only advocates of
                capitalism but even its opponents would claim that this is not a viable alternative. To which I
                poetically respond by paraphrasing &lt;a href="https://merveilles.town/@neauoire"&gt;Devine&lt;/a&gt;:
                “everything is dark under the ultraviolet sun”.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref"
                href="#fnref:disagree" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ol&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;</description>

            <title>Pol.is is quintessential digital democracy</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/polis-is-quintessential-digital-democracy/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pol.is/"&gt;Pol.is&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most exciting things in
                digital democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Democracy in the digital world has many manifestations. It is said that the more people there
                are, the more difficult it is for democracy to exist. I think that’s true, but what I disagree with is
                that the existence of the virtual world makes democracy impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Yes, Facebook &amp;amp; Co. have made democracy significantly harder for everybody, but I don't
                think this is indicative of the &lt;em&gt;nature&lt;/em&gt; of the digital world. Rather, it is
                indicative of the &lt;em&gt;potential power&lt;/em&gt; of the digital world.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With great power comes great responsibility&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_great_power_comes_great_responsibility"&gt;they
                say&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Internet is still in its infancy. We have now seen how its power can be abused but
                eventually we might also see how we can use its power to our benefit. This is exactly what Polis is
                doing.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="exempli-gratia-referenda"&gt;Exempli gratia: referenda&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;For example, referendums are considered a good democracy technique. This is probably because of
                their directness. “What should we do?”, it is asked; and people reply directly. But referendums are very
                problematic. In my philosophy, democracy is the process of reaching consensus and referendums are far
                from the apex. The reason being their lack of concordance mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It feels like the theory of modern referenda is closer to one where everybody is assumed to be
                an independent agent with abstractly different ideas on how to handle a matter at hand. The government
                makes a first selection of the most popular few of these ideas and then the public can choose (without
                any coordination required) the most popular one.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This sucks. The public opinion can be ridiculously easily skewed as we’ve witnessed during the
                last decade. We need a way to coordinate and discuss&lt;sup id="fnref:converse"&gt;&lt;a
                class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:converse"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It is only through discussions and
                interactions that we can acquire a feel of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; and what agenda someone who’s
                pushing for X (whatever X is) has.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Many of my friends have lost hope in democracy during the last 10 years&lt;sup
                id="fnref:hope"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:hope"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, with the
                reason being—I think—humanity’s inability to unite in the virtual world. They now consider solutions
                such as binding decisions mathematically in a distributed database&lt;sup id="fnref:blockchain"&gt;&lt;a
                class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:blockchain"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or trusting the forthcoming
                superintelligence&lt;sup id="fnref:agi"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref"
                href="#fn:agi"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Yet I think we can still do it, we just need suitable tools,
                one of which is Polis.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="polis-v-referenda"&gt;Polis v. referenda&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Do what? Creating space for discussion on current issues, listening to other people’s opinions,
                concerns, and needs—and, finally, agreeing with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href="https://pol.is/"&gt;Polis&lt;/a&gt;. Facilitating this process in the virtual
                world.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;How Polis works in a nutshell: There is a topic (aka problem). Anyone can propose a comment
                (aka solution suggestion). People can vote for or against comments but cannot respond to a comment. In
                parallel to this process, Polis crunches these data (comments and votes) and sorts similar comments
                together in a visual way. This makes it easy to see what people think about the topic at a
                glance.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;With Polis being a tool that facilitates a process, there is still a lot of agency expected for
                it to work effectively. I have no direct experience with it but &lt;a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbCZvU7i7VY"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; on how Taiwan used it looks
                very compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Up until know, we had the technology to facilitate democracy over the internet but all
                discussions almost always veer into chaos. I’ve never before seen an implementation which prevents this
                in an adequate degree. The internet’s entropy is almost always too strong.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But Polis looks like a first answer into how digital democracy could look like. By utilising
                the internet-native power of “always there” (aka always connected, always online) not for the process of
                verbal conflict, but for the process of building agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="quintessentially"&gt;Quintessentially&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As mentioned, I think of democracy as the process of reaching consensus. In this process, time
                is an important factor. Initially, people will have different opinions on the matter at hand, however,
                as &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; progresses opinions will converge&lt;sup id="fnref:aletheia"&gt;&lt;a
                class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:aletheia"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. They will converge, iff everybody
                shares this common&lt;sup id="fnref:everyone"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref"
                href="#fn:everyone"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; goal: the satisfaction of the needs of
                &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; participants. If someone has another agenda, say maximising their own
                satisfaction at the expense of everybody else, this will become apparent through the process (that is,
                the process which is realised as a conversation).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The way Polis works is in harmony with the above philosophy. Polis considers
                &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; an important dimension of the whole process. The theory of modern
                referenda&lt;sup id="fnref:greek"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref"
                href="#fn:greek"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; does not. According to that theory, a referendum is just a
                snapshot&lt;sup id="fnref:repeat"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref"
                href="#fn:repeat"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of the public opinion during one specific day.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Polis is built for large groups of people. Large groups will not vote (or participate in the
                discussion) at the same time. Polis expects that. Large groups cannot vote on everyone’s suggestion.
                Polis expects that as well. This is the reason they &lt;a
                href="https://compdemocracy.org/comment-routing/"&gt;employ statistics&lt;/a&gt; to decide what
                suggestion each user can see and vote on.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The goal here is to strike a balance between a participant thinking about the whole range of
                opinions while at the same time shaping up a feasible conversation. An infeasible one would be 10k
                people deciding about 10k opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;With this, Polis achieves that which everybody else says cannot be achieved: everyone can opine
                about everything. &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is why Polis is quintessential&lt;sup
                id="fnref:utopia"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:utopia"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; digital
                democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

                &lt;li id="fn:converse"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;For software people: from the &lt;a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/"&gt;Manifesto for Agile
                Software Development&lt;/a&gt;: “Individuals and interactions over processes and tools”. Controversial
                opinion: agile is a framework for democracy within software teams. They, too, agree that conversations
                is the way forward, not tools and processes which can always be gamed. From &lt;a
                href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html"&gt;its principles&lt;/a&gt;: “The most efficient and
                effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face
                conversation.”&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:converse" title="Jump back to
                footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;li id="fn:hope"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I could even semi-comically say that the rest of them had lost it before that.&amp;#160;&lt;a
                class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:hope" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the
                text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:blockchain"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I love the technology behind too, I’m just not sure about the shared values and goals of these
                communities.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:blockchain" title="Jump back to
                footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:agi"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I’m also into researching and exploring AI.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref"
                href="#fnref:agi" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:aletheia"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;For philosophers: this &lt;em&gt;convergence&lt;/em&gt; could be considered as another word for
                &lt;em&gt;disclosure&lt;/em&gt;. Disclosure as the process of &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt; becoming
                &lt;em&gt;unconcealed&lt;/em&gt;. But not the &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_theory_of_truth"&gt;truth&lt;/a&gt; we know, &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aletheia"&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; one.&amp;#160;&lt;a
                class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:aletheia" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the
                text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:everyone"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I think &lt;em&gt;wanting&lt;/em&gt; to reach a decision that &lt;em&gt;works for
                everyone&lt;/em&gt; is fundamental to democracy. If, in a collectivity, subgroup A want to make decision
                A while knowing that this will make subgroup B severely unhappy, then I would go as far as to say that
                this collectivity cannot decide democratically.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref"
                href="#fnref:everyone" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:greek"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I was there on the &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Greek_bailout_referendum"&gt;2015 Greek bailout
                referendum&lt;/a&gt;. There was no real, honest, all-cards-open discussion. Everybody had made up their
                mind. There were only emotion-driven arguments, with hidden agendas. No one wanted to satisfy the needs
                of everybody. Everybody wanted to satisfy their own needs only. If that coincided with the satisfaction
                of someone else’s needs as well, that was just an accident.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref"
                href="#fnref:greek" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:repeat"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I believe this is the reason that it is often asked to repeat referenda. It’s the need for a
                second snapshot because, maybe, the first one wasn’t “authentic” enough.&amp;#160;&lt;a
                class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:repeat" title="Jump back to footnote 8 in the
                text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:utopia"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The second candidate for this text’s title was “Digital democratic utopia”. I discarded it
                because people usually discard everything with the word utopia in it. Coincidentally, I think we
                actually relish everything with the word “dystopia” in it. I speculate it’s due to a fear of false hope
                but that’s a psychoanalytic topic for another time.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref"
                href="#fnref:utopia" title="Jump back to footnote 9 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ol&gt;

            <title>Fable on knowledge</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/fable-on-knowledge/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, in universe with Greene number
                &lt;code&gt;#2.3229&lt;sup&gt;293827&lt;/sup&gt;+19&lt;/code&gt; there was a student. He was wondering:
                how come new knowledge is published on scientific magazines which only university people have access to?
                We should enable everyone to access them so that they can research and advance humanity’s knowledge too.
                Right?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;So, he set up a server from inside the university to enable everyone outside to access
                scientific magazines. A bridge, one could say. The university is paying obscene amounts of money to the
                publishing company, &lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;. Odyssey themselves make money with the content that
                scientists create. Scientists get paid by public university money but do not get paid when published by
                Odyssey. So, Odyssey is getting paid by everyone who wants access to something someone else created.
                That this whole thing is a sham is an understatement. Yet nobody was doing anything—except this
                student.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;His bridge worked for a while, but eventually Odyssey noticed him. Not long after, he was
                caught. He was convicted—for enabling open knowledge. Few supported him. In universe with Greene number
                &lt;code&gt;#2.3229&lt;sup&gt;293827&lt;/sup&gt;+19&lt;/code&gt; there is no democracy. Everything is
                adjusted so that the growing rate of the rich companies’ revenue grows. People who strive for the
                betterment of society are—at least sometimes—those who prosper the least. In an alternate &lt;a
                href="/blog/the-imaginary-as-social-foundation/"&gt;imaginary&lt;/a&gt;, it is these people who
                win.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The student hang himself. His life was destroyed. His life was no more. Few cared. And Odyssey?
                They still exist. They still have power. They still control knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A few years later another student had the same idea. Thankfully, she was living in a country
                far from the one Odyssey operated in. Ten years after implementing her solution, she is still alive and
                well. She had some support—not a lot—but it was enough because of her location.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The degree of her impact is the stuff of legends. She managed to allow access to knowledge for
                an outstanding amount of people. Her contribution to universe with Greene number
                &lt;code&gt;#2.3229&lt;sup&gt;293827&lt;/sup&gt;+19&lt;/code&gt; might just be one of the greatest of
                all time.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The finale of her story, though, is still at play—happening right now—in a parallel universe
                next to you. One thing is for sure: she cannot win alone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>In defense of user-defined web fonts</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/in-defense-of-user-defined-web-fonts/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a problem with web fonts. They are big in size. That’s why we have invented
                &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Open_Font_Format"&gt;woff2&lt;/a&gt; which uses &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotli"&gt;brotli&lt;/a&gt; to compress them as efficiently as we
                know. But, I claim: it’s not enough—they are still unjustifiably big.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The problem starts with humans having languages with uncountably many different characters. A
                webfont can be efficiently small if it includes characters only for the latin script. But what if I want
                to write &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt;? Or &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul"&gt;Korean&lt;/a&gt;? Or &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_script"&gt;Tamil&lt;/a&gt;? Something semi-terrible happens
                then. Thankfully, (probably) the text will still be displayed because the browser will fall back to
                another font for the characters the webfont of choice does not define. This will probably be a system
                font, which means it will probably define &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noto_fonts#Etymology"&gt;lots and lots of characters&lt;/a&gt; for
                all scripts. But, terribleness will strike when the style of the fallback font is completely different
                from the style of the primary font. You can see an example of said terribleness &lt;a
                href="https://css-tricks.com/css-basics-fallback-font-stacks-robust-web-typography/#aa-individual-characters"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
                This indeed sucks—so much that I’d rather not use webfonts at all.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;At the same time, I feel you dear reader, it is an important touch for one to choose
                &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; typeface for &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; design. While building &lt;a
                href="https://mataroa.blog/"&gt;mataroa.blog&lt;/a&gt;, I oscillated between using or not using a custom
                font. In the end, I opted for the user’s system fonts.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It makes me sad that I cannot show everyone the beauty of &lt;a
                href="https://mbtype.com/fonts/century-supra/"&gt;Century Supra&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a
                href="http://www.georgduffner.at/ebgaramond/"&gt;EB Garamond&lt;/a&gt;. But it makes me happy that (i)
                my blog platform is insanely fast and (ii) I let my users choose their own fonts.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Since I use &lt;code&gt;font-family: serif&lt;/code&gt;, the fonts used to display my website’s
                text is defined in each user’s &lt;a
                href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/change-fonts-and-colors-websites-use"&gt;browser
                preferences&lt;/a&gt;. In my browser, for example, I have set that to &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baskerville"&gt;Baskerville&lt;/a&gt;. This way I can see the
                typeface I like for all these websites that define &lt;code&gt;font-family: serif&lt;/code&gt;. Yes,
                they are not many—and no, I don’t care that it’s only my own.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

            <title>Against adult supremacy</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/against-adult-supremacy/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;In a few hundred years, when we talk about the past it’ll be this reflection that will
                inhabit the social consciousness: how did we ever think it was normal to treat people as slaves just
                because of their age?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We will look back and disapprove of anyone who forced people do things they didn’t want to,
                just because—at that point—these people were alive for less than 18 years. What we think of slave
                masters now, we’ll think of “adults” then. Because, just like with slaves, there are exactly zero good
                reasons to force another consciousness do something they don’t want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By pouring their derision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;em&gt;Upon anything we did&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;em&gt;Exposing every weakness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;em&gt;However carefully hidden by the kids&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;em&gt;But in the town, it was well known&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;em&gt;When they got home at night, their fat and&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;em&gt;Psychopathic wives would thrash them&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;em&gt;Within inches of their lives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;em&gt;— Pink Floyd, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyTarjUjNMQ"&gt;The Happiest Days of

                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Just like with slave owners, there were some nasty ones but there were also humane ones. The
                same parallel difference exists between strict parents and teachers and more lenient and sympathetic
                ones.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Just like the first people who opposed slavery were considered amusing or funny, most of the
                readers of this text will smile in response, speculating I must be exaggerating.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But the grim reality of our present era is that there is yet one more, very deeply entrenched,
                hierarchy inside our by-other-metrics progressive Western societies. &lt;strong&gt;Some humans among us
                are second rate.&lt;/strong&gt; They are considered of inferior intellect. Just like slaves were
                considered the same. They are not equal citizens. They cannot vote, the fundamental—however
                pretentious—right of democracy has been subtracted from them. Let’s take a moment to really grasp that.
                Remember when women could not vote? We consider that an era of inadequate democracy, an era where only
                half the population was able to take part in defining &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; we live. Well, let’s
                realise now that we disregard this class of humans in such a high degree that we do not even consider
                them as part of the two halves that could &lt;em&gt;potentially&lt;/em&gt; vote.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the future, history books will be rewritten and what they will say about women’s suffrage is
                not that the other half of the population was finally allowed to vote in the 20th century. Instead,
                history books will say that in the 20th century the second &lt;em&gt;third&lt;/em&gt; of the population
                was allowed to vote. It took hundreds of years more for the final third of the population to be
                considered equal.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It feels like the obsolescence of adulthood is so radical that it will take centuries. Consider
                the case of slaves. From the beginning of the first human civilisation—across the globe—in one form or
                another, all peoples had an implementation of the notion of slavery. The worldwide abolition of slavery
                (which is not complete but at least on a very significant degree done) is a victory of gigantic
                proportions for humanity. One of similar proportions will be needed for the abolition of
                adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I don’t know how. Comparing with the abolitionist movement and the women’s right to vote, we
                should start talking and &lt;a
                href="https://johnwall.camden.rutgers.edu/books/give-children-the-vote/"&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; about it.
                This can only be regarded as a first step, though. Maybe we’ll never consider new humans equal. Maybe
                we’ll go the opposite direction and limit their freedom even more. Neither is the future of humanity
                predetermined nor the arrow of progress singular. What will be considered ethical and progressive in a
                hundred years is at play right now. In other words, if we don’t change our definition of
                fairness—ourselves—to include new humans’ opinions as a must-have, then the future world will still be
                fair—just with a different definition of fairness.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;All these lead to an argument I &lt;a href="/blog/the-imaginary-as-social-foundation/"&gt;keep
                making&lt;/a&gt;: we—collectively—are the masters of our own fate whether we know it or not. We decide
                what is fair. Not: “we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; decide what’s fair”. We decide it whether we do it
                consciously or not.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Let’s own it, then. Let’s think about it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard and let’s define
                fairness consciously.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Think we must. Let us think in offices; in omnibuses; while we are standing in the
                crowd watching Coronations and Lord Mayor’s Shows; let us think as we pass the Cenotaph; and in
                Whitehall; in the gallery of the House of Commons; in the Law Courts; let us think at baptisms and
                marriages and funerals. Let us never cease from thinking–what is this “civilization” in which we find
                ourselves? What are these ceremonies and why should we take part in them? What are these professions and
                why should we make money out of them?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;

            <title>Revolut: 7 years later</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/revolut-7-years-later/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;I signed up for Revolut in 2015, shortly after it launched, amidst the &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_controls_in_Greece"&gt;Greek capital controls&lt;/a&gt; era.
                It has been seven years since I started using it as my main bank account. This is my review.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="in-the-beginning"&gt;In the beginning&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Having capital controls is quite crazy and Revolut was a breath of fresh air.
                &lt;em&gt;Revolut&lt;/em&gt; was indeed a &lt;em&gt;revolution&lt;/em&gt; in 2015, especially as an
                antagonist of the Greek banking system.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="revolut-2015.jpeg"
                src="https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/images/47aa24d0.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I loathed every second I had to spend in a bank branch to do utterly ridiculous things such as
                “confirm my details”. Having a mobile-only bank sounded great by definition.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Apart from that, though, Revolut offered many more benefits. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Currency exchange, no fees&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Send money all over Europe, no fees&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Freeze/unfreeze cards instantly&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Unlimited new/replacement cards, free&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Virtual cards&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Easy card PIN control&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="in-medias-res"&gt;In medias res&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In general, I was very happy with Revolut from 2015 to 2020. Lots of progress thoughout the
                years, although I’m not using most of these features. These are things like stock/cryptocurrency
                trading, savings accounts, donations, rewards, phone/travel insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In parallel, they started selling premium plans and limiting free stuff. I was expecting that
                and because I really liked the company, I signed up for their first premium plan and subsequently Metal,
                the most premium of their plans.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="currently"&gt;Currently&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The cycle of disruptive startups who become evil corporations has tired many more before me. In
                our futuristic era, this cycle has seemingly sped up. I reckon it will take Revolut half the time it
                took Google to be hated by a significant percentage of their users.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="revolut weekend exchange"
                src="https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/images/1cdb9e76.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But, what happened? While I was cruising through the years as a paying member, free users were
                introduced to the concept of fees. Namely, for:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Card delivery&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;New/replacement of cards&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;International payments&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Currency exchange&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Currency exchanging an uncommon currency&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Currency exchanging when the market is closed (aka weekend fees)&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In 2022, most of these fees exist in their most premium plan, the Metal plan, as well. This
                makes their Metal plan quite weak.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The reason I liked Revolut and started paying for Metal was to be unconcerned about fees. Now,
                I can’t do that. If I order something online in a currency that’s not GBP, I have to be careful not to
                do it on the weekends, because there is an extra 1% fee. This is silly. It’s also the oldest trick in
                the book of how to build a bank and become the most hated business entity across all industries. Fees,
                conditional on time of transaction, hidden from the UI—that’s why I chose to give up all other banks and
                go to Revolut—not the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But, the most ridiculous thing in the prestigious Revolut Metal Plan is a thing called Metal
                Cashback. I subscribed to Metal in 2018 and my Metal Cashback is ~£72 without ever withdrawing from it.
                But what’s more fun, is that they—not from the beginning though—capped the monthly cashback to be up to
                £12.99—the exact monthly cost of the Revolut most prestigious Metal Plan. This shows they are not
                serious about this feature; it’s just a trick to make subscribers justify the plan’s cost to
                themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;figure style="font-family: sans-serif; margin: 8px 0;"&gt;
                &lt;img src="https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/images/6a666b52.jpeg" alt="revolut cashback website"&gt;
                &lt;figcaption&gt;Revolut website. Clicking “learn more” just shows a download modal rather than
                explaining what “up to” means.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
                &lt;/figure&gt;

                &lt;figure style="font-family: sans-serif;"&gt;
                &lt;img src="https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/images/5a67ccd9.jpeg" alt="revolut cashback app"&gt;
                &lt;figcaption&gt;Revolut app, Metal plan screen. Up to 1% means 0.1% for 99% of my
                transactions.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
                &lt;/figure&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;To conclude about the Metal plan: I don’t like it anymore. I still have to worry about fees and
                I cannot even trust Revolut for telling me if they introduce or change fees. Further critique, about
                Metal cards: low quality, they fall apart even with ordinary use.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The other issue I have with Revolut (but not with their premium plans) is their fraud false
                positives. I’m getting—on average—one transaction blocked per month because it’s being flagged as not
                being initiated by me. Please, Revolut AI, really: it is me who did these transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="revolut fraud sms"
                src="https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/images/28d20a61.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="prospectives"&gt;Prospectives&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Is there hope for a subscription-based no-fees bank? During the last 7 years I have tried:
                Revolut, Monzo, N26, Starling, TransferWise, Bunq, Monese, Atom Bank, Neat, Tandem.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Monzo is my favourite these days. 10 out of 10 app, 10 of 10 business account, 10 out of 10
                onboarding. And... zero fees on EUR payments—imagine when: even on weekends! Or at least that’s what
                they say. I haven’t tested it yet, so not sure if their exchange rate is as good as Revolut’s.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;figure style="font-family: sans-serif;"&gt;
                &lt;img src="https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/images/abce9678.jpeg" alt="monzo terms change"&gt;
                &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href="https://monzo.com/blog/2018/03/20/terms-and-conditions-monzo"&gt;Monzo’s
                transparency&lt;/a&gt; has a much better track record.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
                &lt;/figure&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I’ll try signing up for Chase, as well. Rumours are it has launched in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="epilogue"&gt;Epilogue&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Sad how Revolut has evolved. I had even met the CTO once and we had some interesting
                discussions. He asked if I had any feedback. Now, all I can feed back is that it’s cool Revolut supports
                so many currencies.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="post-epilogue-reflection"&gt;Post-epilogue reflection&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;At the end day, this text is about one person being disappointed about his bank. Big
                whoop.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I regret even writing it. Don’t read it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Introducing allthevaccines.org</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/introducing-allthevaccines-org/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Approximately exactly 16 years ago, I was given a &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantoux_test"&gt;mantoux&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I didn’t know what it was. I thought it was something else. It was just—one day the teacher
                said “next Monday, we’ll have the mantoux vaccination”. Fear bathed the entirety of the class, yet very
                few hesitated.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The mantoux sting was supposed to be a small price to pay for eternal defense against an
                unknown disease. Turns out it’s not even a vaccine. But it is potentially life saving.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Three weeks ago I realised my motivation to discover the full extent of the miracle that we
                call vaccines. I made &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a
                href="https://allthevaccines.org/"&gt;allthevaccines.org&lt;/a&gt;, a website in which I’ve tried to
                compile information about all human vaccines.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Today is the day the MVP launches. It features:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Almost&lt;/em&gt; all vaccines that are actively consumed in the Western
                world.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Almost&lt;/em&gt; all diseases for which there are vaccines for humans.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Links for each vaccine to trusted entities such as the &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, the
                &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Medicines_Agency"&gt;European Medicines
                Agency&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Medicines_Compendium"&gt;Electronic Medicines
                Compendium&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt;, pharma manufacturer
                websites, and other government websites.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Why did I make it? Well, I wanted a place to find all vaccines and read about them. I couldn’t
                find any. Searching for non-covid vaccines is also almost impossible, as all websites imply
                &lt;em&gt;covid&lt;/em&gt; vaccines when they say vaccines. So I took upon the challenge of compiling
                this info. We’re still in the early stages but I think it is currently in a usable state.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the process of building it, I’ve learned a lot about vaccines. For example, I learned that
                smallpox is the only human disease we have &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eradication_of_infectious_diseases"&gt;successfully and completely
                eradicated&lt;/a&gt;. There is no smallpox in the wild anymore and there is no need to take a vaccine
                for it. How amazing is that?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It seems there are just over 30 diseases that affect humans for which we have vaccines. One of
                them is called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_encephalitis"&gt;Japanese
                encephalitis&lt;/a&gt;. Having lived in Europe my whole life (as a non-doctor), I had never heard of
                it.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I learned about a guy, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Hilleman"&gt;Maurice
                Hilleman&lt;/a&gt;, who developed over 40 vaccines. That sounds a lot, but I have no idea how many more
                these are in relation to the average vaccinologist. Turns out it’s way more.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;“Very few people, even in the scientific community, are even remotely aware of the scope of
                what Maurice has contributed,” Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institutes of Allergy and
                Infectious Diseases, noted at the symposium. “I recently asked my post-docs whether they knew who had
                developed the measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B and chickenpox vaccines. They had no idea,” Fauci
                said. “When I told them that it was Maurice Hilleman, they said, 'Oh, you mean that grumpy guy who comes
                to all of the AIDS meetings?'”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nm1223"&gt;It was once estimated&lt;/a&gt; that
                Maurice’s work saves ~8 million lives &lt;em&gt;per year&lt;/em&gt;. That’s probably the most amazing
                metric of all time.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="tb-sucks-or-what-is-the-mantoux-really"&gt;TB sucks. Or: what is the mantoux
                really?&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Maurice created successful vaccines for lots of diseases. One of the diseases that he didn’t
                create a vaccine for, is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"&gt;Tuberculosis
                (TB)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis (aka &lt;em&gt;consumption&lt;/em&gt;) is caused by a bacterium (not a virus), the
                &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"&gt;mycobacterium
                tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt;. TB can be either active or &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_tuberculosis"&gt;latent&lt;/a&gt;. If active, then one has
                the symptoms and the sickness. If latent, there are no symptoms and there is a ~10% chance it will
                progress to active. If left untreated, there is a &lt;a
                href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis"&gt;~45% chance of
                death&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the futuristic year of 2022, there is no good vaccine for TB. There is one semi-good,
                though, the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCG_vaccine"&gt;BCG vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. It’s
                semi-good because:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Among children, it prevents about ~19% from getting infected and among those who do get
                infected, it protects a ~58% from developing disease.&lt;br&gt;
                — &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4122754/"&gt;Source from
                2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;What’s worse, as many times as you get boosted by it, the efficiency percentage does not
                improve. If that wasn't enough...&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;...the BCG vaccine is also racist:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Trials conducted in the UK have consistently shown a protective effect of 60 to 80%, but those
                conducted elsewhere have shown no protective effect, and efficacy appears to fall the closer one gets to
                the equator.&lt;br&gt;
                — &lt;em&gt;Source: &lt;code&gt;doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(95)92348-9&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As the reader might have already guessed from the attitude of this vaccine, we don’t even know
                how long the protection of the BCG lasts (ok, we do approximately but it’s not conclusive, much less for
                non-white people, see &lt;code&gt;doi:10.1001/jama.291.17.2086&lt;/code&gt;). But this is where we come
                full circle.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;There was a guy called Charles Mantoux. He thought, what if, we could detect the latent kind of
                TB. Then we could save that 10% and everyone would be happier. And so we did. The &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantoux_test"&gt;Mantoux test&lt;/a&gt; (aka tuberculin skin test or
                TST) is a test to check if someone has latent TB.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The test goes as such:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Extract tuberculin, aka “purified protein derivative”, from the TB bacterium.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Inject it &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intradermal_injection"&gt;intradermally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Wait 3 days.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Measure the diameter of the induration (aka hardened skin) in the injection spot.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ol&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Now, it would be great if we could just say: if it’s within &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; to
                &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; millimeters, then one is latent TB positive. But this asshole disease and its
                test have yet another trick up their sleeve. A person’s conditions and risk factors change the range of
                what is considered positive. CDC has an interpretation of the, so called, &lt;a
                href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/factsheets/testing/skintesting.htm"&gt;classification of
                tuberculin reaction&lt;/a&gt; but as one might have guessed, measuring a pimple is not exactly
                conclusive (&lt;code&gt;doi:10.1164/ajrccm.159.1.9801120&lt;/code&gt;). Briefly, if someone has “no
                known risk factors” for TB, then to be positive is to have an induration diameter of 15mm or more.
                However, if some is HIV-positive, then even 5mm is enough to be latent TB positive. Having had contact
                with a TB patient is another reason for such a low cut off point.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If this method does not seem very credible to the esteemed reader, I sympathise. Not only does
                15mm (or 5mm) seem quite arbitrary but it also &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantoux_test#False_positive_result"&gt;looks like&lt;/a&gt; there
                are many reasons to get a false positive, including having gotten the BCG vaccine (!), as well as many
                reasons to get a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantoux_test#False_negative_result"&gt;false
                negative&lt;/a&gt;. How are we all not dead with TB, I do not know.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I do plan to &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/blog/how-we-conquered-consumption"&gt;find
                out&lt;/a&gt; though. I’m sure it will be equally interesting with what I have discovered until
                now.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Future improvements for &lt;a
                href="https://allthevaccines.org/"&gt;allthevaccines.org&lt;/a&gt; include distilled info of the most
                important bits for each disease, as well as—hopefully—&lt;em&gt;exactly all&lt;/em&gt; (rather than
                &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; all) the vaccines that are actively manufactured and consumed (still
                searching for a comprehensive list).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="https://allthevaccines.org/"&gt;allthevaccines.org&lt;/a&gt; is open
                source. Hack it away at:&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Django Project Initialisation Process</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/django-init-process/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;When I start a new Django project I can never remember what are the steps to arrive at
                a functional boilerplate with one Django app, the simplest view to get started, and all dependencies
                set.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is a documentation of this process.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="preparation"&gt;Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We assume our project’s name is &lt;code&gt;earth&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We assume we have these installed:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;bash&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;git&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;python3&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>It’s not the industry that sucks</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/its-not-the-industry-that-sucks/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Technology.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I love it as essence, as the way of making things that on the surface seem magical. I hate it
                as an industry, of what “big tech” has come to mean the last decade and how technology companies affect
                the world.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I considered these two as separate concepts in my mind, yet as time passes they have converged.
                How can one love technology if the only way they can interact with it is through companies that not only
                do not care for societal betterment but also actively contribute to its detriment?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Google invades our privacy to sell ads. Amazon exploits warehouse workers for next day
                deliveries. Facebook sells ads to anyone—however malicious—that buys them. The examples are
                many.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The majority of my friends in the domain agree. They are sad about their work and our industry.
                Many are worried that maybe they are actively making the world worse, after all. Most of the time it’s
                hard to know; things can spiral out of control even if in the beginning everything seems to have the
                right moral compass.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But I think the problem is not the industry nor technology as essence. It’s the context it
                exists within. And this context is the same for all industries: our societal and economic
                system.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Ask anyone; how do they feel about their industry? The responses I got were almost always
                negative. Technology? Silicon Valley thinks it’s saving the world. Healthcare? Nurses (and/or doctors)
                being paid meagre wages while doing an extremely hard and valuable job. Art? Millions of artists
                unappreciated and unable to live off their work and a small elite controlling the industry. Hospitality?
                Low wages for tiring and intellectually non-stimulating work. Transportation? Delivery? E-commerce?
                Energy? I think the reader can fill in the answers from their own experience.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;All of these problems have one holy mantra as common denominator: &lt;em&gt;we have to maximise
                our profits&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Everything else trickles down from there. Google and Amazon—and every other company—have to
                increase their profits quarter to quarter, however ludicrous they already are. They have to find that
                0.001% optimisation that will save them millions. This could mean shortening a worker’s 23-minute break
                to 21 minutes, or tracking users in this new, slightly more creepy way&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;These companies did not start evil. They began fresh, as the underdogs on a mission to make the
                world a better place. Google’s mission was &lt;em&gt;to organize the world’s information and make it
                universally accessible and useful&lt;/em&gt;. They did pretty well, dare I say.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="feel-good-jamie-sm.jpg"
                src="https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/images/9ee8154f.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Amazon’s was to &lt;em&gt;offer customers the lowest possible prices, the best available
                selection, and the utmost convenience&lt;/em&gt;. Pretty good result for customers. Ordering anything
                and having it tomorrow on my doorstep is pretty fucking utopian if you ask me, the customer. But what
                about the workers?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean—of course—that this is an argument against progress. I’m only against that
                which exploits others to achieve its end. In this case we exploit many to have next-day delivery and we
                even exploit ourselves&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref"
                href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to have a web search engine and free email. We can progress
                without exploiting others and we should do that even if it takes more time and effort to do
                so.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;All this, in the end, seems like an instance of instrumental convergence. Nick Bostrom’s &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence#Paperclip_maximizer"&gt;paperclip
                maximiser&lt;/a&gt; is the thought experiment that comes to mind:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Suppose we have an AI whose only goal is to make as many paper clips as possible. The AI will
                realize quickly that it would be much better if there were no humans because humans might decide to
                switch it off. Because if humans do so, there would be fewer paper clips. Also, human bodies contain a
                lot of atoms that could be made into paper clips. The future that the AI would be trying to gear towards
                would be one in which there were a lot of paper clips but no humans.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;— Nick Bostrom&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;For our socio-economic system, the paperclip is the GDP or a company’s quarterly revenue.
                Everything at the altar of maximising profits—whatever it is, it’s less important than profit anyway. It
                &lt;a href="/blog/the-imaginary-as-social-foundation/"&gt;doesn’t have to be&lt;/a&gt; this way, though.
                We can all agree to designate human wellbeing as the paperclip, rather than GDP or quarterly revenue.
                Hopefully such a policy change seems more easily achievable than next-day delivery of all items humanity
                produces.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
                &lt;hr&gt;
                &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We exploit ourselves by allowing ourselves to be spied by relinquishing control of our own
                data.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the
                text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;

            <title>From one to many: Self-governed communities in three steps</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/from-one-to-many-self-governed-communities-in-three-steps/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;I think there is merit in being part of a community for a cause. The cause can be
                anything, from a hobby to a societal issue. Sometimes the creation of the community just springs out of
                conversations and shared values. Some other times it starts in the mind of one person. How do we start
                from that One person’s thought and end up in a community of shared ownership?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We might unconsciously associate communities with grassroots movements and democratic
                governance but this doesn’t have to be the case. Not all communities are democratic and many times it’s
                hard to say whether one is.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;For this text, though, let’s assume we aim for democratic self-governance. The hard question we
                aspire to answer is how we start with One founder and end up with many collective owners while also
                being a sustainably self-managed group of people.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="step-1-get-people-hyped"&gt;Step 1: Get people hyped&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The cause drives the community. The One is firstly part of the cause. This cause will probably
                already have some established gathering places (virtual or IRL) in some form or another.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Even though our economy is competitive, our communities can only survive through cooperation.
                Interdependence is crucial and through that network communities can flourish. Being as independent as
                possible is considered important for survival yet I have found out that it’s usually the opposite that
                happens. However much independence a community has, it’s impossible to survive; it is through
                dependencies to other communities (through the edges of a graph) that make the communities themselves
                (the nodes of the graph) more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is why I think it’s an important first step for the first One to join these communities
                and their gatherings. This can mean a number of things in reality. Maybe the cause organises on Facebook
                Groups or through meetups. Or maybe they are under another umbrella cause or organisation. Whatever the
                case, this is where One starts.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To illustrate further, maybe:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;The cause is about fixed gear bicycles, and the gathering square for many is at a specific
                bike shop.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;The cause is about helping refugees in a city and people coordinate through Facebook
                Groups.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;The cause is about functional programming and there is a meetup group that organises
                presentations every month.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Once One has joined the existing communities, they can connect with them and share their
                vision. This is what gets people hyped. On our examples above:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;“Wouldn’t it be awesome if we had a fixed gear bicycle race in the streets of our
                city?”&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;“Wouldn’t it be amazing if we could actually provide shelter to the newly homeless
                refugees?”&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;“Wouldn’t it be great if we had more people write in functional languages and subsequently
                raise the quality of our libraries?”&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Once people are hyped, they are ready to dedicate themselves for the cause. They are ready to
                spend a few hours per week or per month to realise this awesome vision that was conceived and shared
                with them.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="step-2-share-ownership"&gt;Step 2: Share ownership&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Once there are some additional members, the first thing the One will notice is that this is the
                One’s thing. It’s their baby. They made it an entity and the fellow associates try to improve it. Some
                may contribute a bit, others more, but maybe no one as much as the first One. This is a crucial point.
                It’s when the One might want to share ownership. In this way, the One actively shows to the associates
                who believed in them and followed them that this is their baby too. The babyness metamorphoses into a
                distributed essence.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In order for the One to share ownership, they need to actually share the ownership. Hand the
                keys to the associates, whether those are login credentials or actual keys of an office; or maybe adding
                them as directors in a limited company. Convince them with actions that it’s their baby too.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In my experience from the past decade, people embrace that. They respect it and do not betray
                it.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To judge whether the ownership sharing process was successful is to ask whether the concept of
                the One within the community has died.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Once that’s done the community will be entering—among other things—a spiral of informal and
                formal ceremonies. The formal ones are usually the essence of the community. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Cycling communities go for bike rides. Maybe every Friday at 9pm. That's the formal ceremony.
                But some evenings, people gather at the aforementioned bike shop and talk and drink beers. This is where
                they schedule the bike rides. This is the informal ceremony.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Refugee Facebook groups donate food and clothes and help refugees. They have a weekly meeting
                where they gather all the food and clothes and deliver them to the shelter (formal ceremony). Everyday
                at lunch and afternoons, they learn about the news of the cause, think of new ways to help and share
                views (informal ceremonies).&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Programming communities do meetups or hackathons or conferences. They have scheduled events
                (formal ceremonies) or casual hangouts offline or online (informal ceremonies).&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It’s a spiral because it’s a cycle yet also slightly different every time. There is progress to
                it. There is a certain directionality, which is hopefully towards improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Once these ceremonies are set, they are hard to change. They become part of the culture of the
                community. This is important to be aware of in case of the ceremonies not being nice.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Even though ceremonies are processes, they are not explicit processes. They are implicit
                processes and this is the reason that they are not enough to fight inherent entropy.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="step-3-establish-processes"&gt;Step 3: Establish processes&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To tackle inherent entropy, a community needs processes—the explicit kind.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;These are the boring bits which if not existent, the harder it will be to keep the community
                from withering away. It will also not be obvious the community needs processes until too late. Thus,
                they need to be set early. Too early and people will lose their enthusiasm from the bureaucracy; too
                late and they won’t be bothered to participate at all.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;These processes establish the community, like a ship sailing on its own. They need to include
                answers to things like:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;How do we get new members?&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;How do we introduce new projects?&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;How do we make decisions collectively?&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;What kind is our entity towards others, such as the city, other communities, the
                government?&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;What are some of the values we share and actualise in this community?&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;How do we handle disagreements?&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it should be noted that in this balance of processes that needs to be achieved,
                there is another factor that usually causes derailment. Arguing for the point of arguing and not for the
                point of practical progress. Some people are more susceptible than others in this, but in general, there
                needs to be active re-evaluation of the scope of the processes.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;“What if someone evil comes and decides to do a hostile takeover of our community?”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The above is an example of a question that tends to extend the scope of process definition
                infinitely. My advice is to contain these kind of discussions, either temporally (eg. timebox them) or
                by their cardinality (designate a working group of a few people to figure it out).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The general rule is to create processes for the current people and the current problems. Beyond
                that, it can wait.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Now, to provide an opinion to the question above, I think the balance is between shielding old
                members and sharing ownership with the new. If you shield too much, then you’re less democratic and new
                members are not as genuine members. If you share ownership too much, then it’s easier for new members to
                change the community faster than the community’s culture has got to them. I generally vote sharing
                ownership more and risking takeovers as—usually—moving into a new community is easy enough.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="epilogue"&gt;Epilogue&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Democracy is hard but I think it’s worth it. Especially for communities which usually begin
                with volunteer work, democracy is both of vital importance and—sometimes surprisingly—the default form
                it starts with. In addition to that, the less people there are, the easier democracy is to implement.
                For instance, in a city or country level implementing democracy is orders of magnitude harder. Thus, if
                one values democracy, it’s worth practising it in a small community.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The crucial thing to accept in these kind of communities is that this is everyone’s baby and
                that ownership only exists as shared ownership. Even though one started it, or one has made the most
                significant contribution, or one fights for it more, it’s still fair and possible for that person to be
                voted out tomorrow. Avoiding that is definitely an objective, but accepting it is the key. This
                acceptance is what solidifies the distributed ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;“Freedom is not worth having if it does not include the freedom to make mistakes.”&lt;br&gt;
                — Mahatma Gandhi&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Abolishing vendor lock-in</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/abolishing-vendor-lock-in/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Vendor lock-in one of the saddest feelings when using software.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It should be a calculated risk but usually it isn’t and thus ends up becoming an unforeseen
                limitation. It is a feeling of entrapment, a prison of sorts. “If only we could move our database to X
                tomorrow, &lt;em&gt;just like that&lt;/em&gt;”—with a finger snap.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But even if it is calculated from the beginning, there is a yet better scenario; to escape it
                completely.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;One of the core ideas behind &lt;a href="https://mataroa.blog/"&gt;mataroa.blog&lt;/a&gt; (the
                blogging platform I’m building) is that users should be able to leave as easy as possible and self-host
                their blog. The goal is to &lt;a href="https://mataroa.blog/modus/operandi/"&gt;empower personal
                independent blogs&lt;/a&gt; in any case.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="two-steps-towards-vendor-independence"&gt;Two steps towards vendor independence&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The first step for vendor independence is for a vendor-official exit to merely exist. For
                online platforms, it might be hard to do that well. Every platform is different and there is no
                interoperability. You can’t take all your Twitter tweets and transform them into Facebook posts, for
                example.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;With blogging things are a bit easier. For example, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; import your
                WordPress blog posts into Medium.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;With that in mind, we build export functionality in mataroa.blog from the beginning. One can
                export their blog posts into simple markdown text files, or into &lt;a
                href="https://www.getzola.org/"&gt;Zola&lt;/a&gt; sources, or &lt;a
                href="https://gohugo.io/"&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; sources. Static site generators are one of the best ways to
                host a blog, which is also the reason of offering these export choices.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The second step after making it possible is to make it easy.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;That’s why the “redirect to a new blog domain” feature exists. Suppose you decide to start a
                blog at &lt;code&gt;thoughts.mataroa.blog&lt;/code&gt;. After a few posts, you decide you want to move
                to your own domain and theme. You want Google and whoever comes across these old tweets that point to
                your old URL to be able to see what you wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="third-step"&gt;Third step&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I realised recently what’s a good third step: &lt;strong&gt;minimise the risk of losing vendor
                independence&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It’s possible for users to leave mataroa using the export feature. And it is easier to do so
                with the redirect feature. But, what if these things stop working?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is where a new feature comes in: &lt;a
                href="https://hey.mataroa.blog/blog/monthly-auto-exports-via-email/"&gt;monthly auto-exports via
                email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Every month an email goes to all users that have it enabled. This email has one attachment:
                &lt;strong&gt;a zip archive of all your blog posts in markdown format&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Providing the ability to take backups is never enough. Users need to be convinced to store
                these backups too. If they are convinced to do that, then the risk of data loss is significantly
                mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In this way we don’t need to convince users! We can safely store a user’s blog on their side
                with the simple action of periodically emailing them the backup.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Surely, there is a limit on the amount of data that can fit in an email, though, right? There
                is, and it’s 50MB for Gmail. That’s pretty high for text though and &lt;a
                href="https://mataroa.blog/"&gt;mataroa.blog&lt;/a&gt; is a text focused platform.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But whatever the case, a good first step.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Book: The Burnout Society by Byung-Chul Han</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/book-the-burnout-society-by-byung-chul-han/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=25725"&gt;The Burnout
                Society&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byung-Chul_Han"&gt;Byung-Chul
                Han&lt;/a&gt; might be the book I discussed the most since I read it, four months ago. Rarely does one
                read books that change their already formed views towards society. Even more rare of an event is when a
                book makes one doubt their life philosophies and long-established goals. I think &lt;em&gt;The Burnout
                Society&lt;/em&gt; had such an influence for me and even though I was already leaning close to the
                book’s thesis, I hadn’t heard or read such a coherent rendering of it before.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The book talks about that underlying part of Western society that we all know, yet may not have
                quite nailed as a thing in itself. It’s about the constant thirst for individual achievement, personal
                accomplishment, or just &lt;em&gt;having an impact&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;There is a deep level of insight and the &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic#Hegelian_dialectic"&gt;antithetic&lt;/a&gt; proposal
                becomes obvious (to abstain from the problematic things the author describes) yet never explicitly
                stated. The book is purely social criticism, powerful enough to shatter our &lt;a
                href="/blog/the-imaginary-as-social-foundation/"&gt;social imaginary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It is composed of eight chapters which I will try to briefly summarise.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the first chapter, Byung-Chul starts with a core argument of the book’s thesis:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Neurological illnesses such as depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
                borderline personality disorder (BPD), and burnout syndrome [...] do not follow from the negativity of
                what is immunologically foreign, but from an excess of positivity. &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The author defines the era of the past century as an immunological era, which has resulted to
                our current era being deprived of any negativity as it has been successfully purged.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The epoch sought to distinguish clearly between inside and outside, friend and foe, self and
                other. The Cold War also followed an immunological pattern. [...] Even if [something] has no hostile
                intentions, even if it poses no danger, it is eliminated on the basis of its Otherness.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;That’s an interesting take on recent world history; yet it almost feels like playing with
                words. It becomes even sillier when the author says that eliminating all otherness in a political
                context results in neurological illnesses for individuals. But this kind of silliness sounded radical,
                which made me keep on reading to see if it was the kind of radical I’m fond of.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the second chapter, Byung-Chul talks about today’s society not being &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discipline_and_Punish"&gt;Foucault’s disciplinary society&lt;/a&gt;,
                but rather an achievement society.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In contrast to a disciplinary society, which is a society of negativity that prohibits
                &lt;em&gt;(don’t/should)&lt;/em&gt;, an achievement society is one that positively encourages
                &lt;em&gt;(can)&lt;/em&gt;. Still, Byung-Chul says, the achievement-subject remains
                disciplined.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Clearly, the drive to maximize production inhabits the social unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Being achievement-subjects, we are much more productive. Discipline-subjects work because they
                &lt;em&gt;shouldn’t&lt;/em&gt; be slackers; achievement-subjects work because they
                &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; become millionaires.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In this way, the achievement-subject being exploits itself. Voluntarily, it becomes both the
                abuser and the abused.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is where things start to make sense. There is clearly an insatiable need in our society to
                maximise production, achievement, impact. And indeed, this need overcomes the need for rest. I recall
                recent conversations with coworkers, residents of the United States, that take pride in sleeping 5 hours
                every night and starting work at 5AM. The self-abuse that Byung-Chul talks about is obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The discussion about disciplinary versus achievement started to make more sense with this
                statement by the author:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Disciplinary society’s [...] negativity produces madmen and criminals. In contrast, achievement
                society creates depressives and losers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Almost too absolute yet seemingly a true insight, that seems completely obvious in
                retrospect—at least obvious to consider if not accept. Oversimplifying: weren’t hysteria and madness
                things that used to be talked much more in the past and depression a thing that governs the present? I
                have this feeling, which might be false, but it definitely feels true.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the third chapter, Byung-Chul talks about boredom. In praise of idleness, like &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Praise_of_Idleness_and_Other_Essays"&gt;Bertrand
                said&lt;/a&gt;—yet not quite in the same sense.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The aforementioned (from the previous chapters) excessive positivity of our society leads to
                excessive stimuli and information. As a result, a new form of attention develops:
                &lt;em&gt;hyperattention&lt;/em&gt;. Characterised by rapid diffusion of information and fast change of
                focus, hyperattention means that our tolerance for boredom abates.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But, boredom is quite important. The author claims it to be fundamental for the spark of
                creativity to arise. Presumably, this is how we started dancing:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If a person experiences boredom while walking and has no tolerance for this state, he will move
                restlessly in fits and starts or go this way and that. However, someone with greater tolerance for
                boredom will recognize, after a while, that walking as such is what bores him. Consequently, he will be
                impelled to find a kind of movement that is entirely different. Running, or racing, does not yield a new
                gait. It is just accelerated walking. Dancing or gliding, however, represent entirely new forms of
                motion. Only human beings can dance. It may be that boredom seized him while walking, so that after—and
                through—this “attack” he would make the step from walking to dancing. Compared with linear walking,
                straight ahead, the convoluted movement of dancing represents a luxury; it escapes the
                achievement-principle entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Such a satisfying hypothesis and at the same time beautifully depicting the argument in favour
                of boredom.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Circling back to the existence of excess of positivity, we employ multitasking in order to deal
                with it. Byung-Chul remarks that this is a step backwards in terms of cultural quality. Multitasking is
                common to animals who while eating must be careful not to be eaten. Deep focus, instead, is the
                intellectual technique to which we owe humanity’s cultural achievements.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If sleep represents the high point of bodily relaxation, deep boredom is the peak of mental
                relaxation. &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IV.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The fourth chapter of the book is titled &lt;em&gt;Vita Activa&lt;/em&gt;. Hannah Arendt
                described this concept in her book &lt;em&gt;The Human Condition&lt;/em&gt;, in which she wanted to
                redeem it against &lt;em&gt;vita contemplativa&lt;/em&gt;. According to Hannah, &lt;em&gt;vita
                activa&lt;/em&gt; is being misinterpreted as just restlessness, whereas it can actually be heroic
                action.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;She says modern society forces humans into &lt;em&gt;animal laborans&lt;/em&gt;, a concept that
                designates humanity’s defining characteristic as labour, rather than thinking. As &lt;em&gt;animal
                laborans&lt;/em&gt; there is no &lt;em&gt;vita activa&lt;/em&gt;—only passivity.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Byung-Chul states that &lt;em&gt;animal laborans&lt;/em&gt; are no more, though. An individual
                out of Hannah’s model is supposed to relinquish their individuality (ego) and merge in the “over-all
                life process of the species”. Instead, in today’s achievement society ego is
                &lt;em&gt;cultivated&lt;/em&gt; by labour.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Indeed, merging our individuality for the humanity as species and its objectives is not part of
                our individual-obsessed culture. Such a process would be part of a culture that is defined by
                collectivity, not individuality.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the second half of the chapter, the author speaks about the fleetingness of modern life.
                Hyperattention (chapter 3) is our society’s reaction to this lack of being, as he calls it. Everyone
                carries a labour camp inside them, in which, he says, “one is simultaneously prisoner and guard, victim
                and perpetrator”.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It was at this point that I thought that this book is probably the genius kind of radical. It
                is indeed ourselves &lt;em&gt;from within&lt;/em&gt; that compels us to keep working and keep achieving.
                The incessant need to augment our ego in order to matter in the grand scheme of things.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Life, somehow, is more ephemeral than ever. It is only through our accomplishments that we can
                achieve immortality, which will bring the desired success of our individuality.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Byung-Chul ends the chapter with a comment on religions:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Even religions, as thanatotechnics that would remove the fear of death and produce a feeling of
                duration, have run their course. &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;V.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Chapter five is where Byung-Chul talks about the power to say no, i.e. the power to express
                negativity.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to Hegel, negativity is precisely what keeps existence [Dasein] alive.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;positive potency&lt;/em&gt; is the power to do something and
                &lt;em&gt;impotency&lt;/em&gt; is the exact opposite, that is the inability to act, then there is also
                &lt;em&gt;negative potency&lt;/em&gt; which is the power to not do something.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Arguments from the first and the third chapter now connect: we lack negative potency as we have
                purged ourselves of all negativity. Lacking the ability to say no to something (say no as in block it
                and not perceive it), the result is an excess of stimuli: hyperattention.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The author also touches on Zen meditation here, in which the objective to free oneself from all
                distractions requires activity.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VI.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Chapter six is about &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartleby%2C_the_Scrivener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bartleby, the
                Scrivener&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a short story by Herman Melville. Bartleby, who’s an above-average
                skilled scribe, starts responding to all requests with “I would prefer not to”.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Byung-Chul analyses how the society portrayed in the story is a disciplinary society. Further,
                he notices a lack of excess positivity, at which point he disagrees with an analysis of the story by
                &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Agamben"&gt;Giorgio Agamben&lt;/a&gt;. According to
                Byung-Chul, Bartleby is not the &lt;em&gt;absolute potency&lt;/em&gt;. Him being an employee of the Dead
                Letter Office, also, depicts a negativity that contradicts Agamben’s ontotheological
                interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Byung-Chul concludes that the story is not really about de-creation, but rather about
                exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I was neither entirely convinced of the above conclusion nor about what point Byung-Chul is
                really trying to make here. Byung-Chul states that the society in &lt;em&gt;Bartleby, the
                Scrivener&lt;/em&gt; is a disciplinary one, yet somehow there is exhaustion of the achievement-society’s
                kind.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It is a very thought-provoking story nonetheless, with both analyses insightful and
                astute.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The exclamation that ends the tale is both a lament and an indictment: “Ah Bartleby! Ah
                humanity!”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VII.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The penultimate chapter is called &lt;em&gt;The Society of Tiredness&lt;/em&gt;. Bilingual
                reviewers say this chapter title is also a better translation of the original German book title
                &lt;em&gt;Müdigkeitsgesellschaft&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Here, the author draws a lot from Peter Handke’s &lt;a
                href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250767257"&gt;Essay on Tiredness&lt;/a&gt;. Tiredness in our
                achievement society is solitary tiredness. This is in contrast to another kind; the tiredness that
                trusts in the world. While the trusting tiredness dissolves ego and makes room for an &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_(philosophy)"&gt;Otherness&lt;/a&gt;, solitary tiredness
                results in an exhausted ego.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;[Handke] calls it “we-tiredness”. I am not tired “of you,” as he puts it, but rather I am tired
                “with you”.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is another interesting aspect of the achievement society. While striving to achieve, one
                gets tired. The target, or motivation, in this tiredness-inducing process is inward-looking; it is the
                self. It is in this way that the ego gets exhausted. It is “used up” as motivation fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In contrast, in a attempt to strive for something that has others as target, the
                tiredness-inducing process is outward-looking. Trusting others to continue with the tiredness-inducing
                process, whatever that might be. There is no ego to play the role of motivation. Ego, instead, melts,
                firstly because the target of the work is an otherness and, secondly, because getting tired results in
                relinquishing control of the work (i.e. tiredness-inducing process) to an otherness.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIII.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the final chapter, Byung-Chul claims that today’s achievement society is much different than
                the disciplinary society that Freud developed psychoanalysis for. So much different that he believes
                that a person’s psyche is, also, much different and thus psychoanalysis is irrelevant for the
                achievement-subject.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In our society of achievement, there is less and less negativity and prohibition. There is
                instead more and more freedom. An achievement-subject does not work out of duty (defined by others;
                targeted at others), but rather out of pleasure (defined by itself; targeted at itself).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This absence of relation to the Other is problematic especially in terms of gratification. The
                achievement-subject cannot draw satisfaction from its work because there’s no one to commend it. Hence,
                the achievement-subject feels compelled to do more and more.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This combination of lack of satisfaction and self-exploitation (chapter 2) results in burnout.
                As the achievement-subject is subject to no one but itself, it &lt;em&gt;liberates&lt;/em&gt; itself
                into a &lt;em&gt;project&lt;/em&gt;. It is liberation, because the achievement-subject does that in the
                name of freedom, of being free to do &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; which pleases it. And it is a project—and
                not a subject—in the etymological sense, as it is not subjugated. It (the subject itself) needs to be
                something positive, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In this way, though, the violence does not disappear. The violence now originates from itself.
                As we said in chapter 2, this is now a self-exploitation. It is represented as a freedom, yet it is
                still a (self-) coercion.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This result makes the capitalist system much more efficient as self-exploitation includes the
                illusion of freedom. Freedom and violence now coincide.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the final pages, Byung-Chul examines Agamben’s &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Agamben#Homo_Sacer:_Sovereign_Power_and_Bare_Life_.281995.29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;homo
                sacer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He declares:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;[The homines sacri of achievement society] cannot be killed at all. Their life equals that of
                the undead. They are too alive to die and too dead to live.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="epilogue"&gt;Epilogue&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;When I started reading this book I thought the author was using word metaphors to describe the
                real world, almost in a kabbalistic interpretation. How can immunology describe an era and somehow this
                metaphor to result in mental conditions?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Also, how does all this reconcile with current psychology? My guess would be not very well. The
                obvious argument that what the book describes is just a different—i.e. a philosophical—approach probably
                satisfies neither philosophers nor psychologists.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Yet, even though the first chapter felt silly, as I continued reading, everything made sense.
                In the end, it somehow made total sense. I remain cautious of its thesis but at the same time I feel
                this book changed many of my world views. At least in the way that I try to examine things through
                Byung-Chul’s lens now.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I’m quite astounded by The Burnout Society. It’s a genius book. Reading it has
                generated this weird feeling that comes up when something quite profound has happened. The feeling that
                I cannot remember how it was to exist before having experienced it.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>The imaginary as social foundation</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/the-imaginary-as-social-foundation/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;In this text I present the philosophy of &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_Castoriadis"&gt;Cornelius Castoriadis&lt;/a&gt; in the
                context of the current sociopolitical landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="imaginary"&gt;Imaginary&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In 1975, the genius of Cornelius Castoriadis published &lt;em&gt;L’Institution imaginaire de la
                société&lt;/em&gt;, aka &lt;a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/imaginary-institution-society"&gt;The
                Imaginary Institution of Society&lt;/a&gt;. In this book, he said that every society has a set of core,
                underlying values and beliefs which constitute its foundation. They define how people perceive what’s
                worth doing and what matters in the society. This is called the &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_(sociology)"&gt;imaginary&lt;/a&gt; of a
                society.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;For instance, Cornelius said, for a Jewish person living two thousand years ago, the question
                of whether the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah"&gt;Torah&lt;/a&gt; is fair
                &lt;em&gt;cannot be asked&lt;/em&gt;. The belief that Torah &lt;em&gt;defines&lt;/em&gt; what’s fair, is
                written by God, and there is no questioning it, is foundational for the Jewish society.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Every society across the world sets its own imaginary; however, almost all of them believe that
                it was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; them who set it. They believe that it was &lt;em&gt;something
                else&lt;/em&gt; that gave principal significance to this set of beliefs and values they
                follow.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Therefore, they believe they &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; change this set of beliefs and values.
                The imaginary remains the same because they have no control over it, as they believe it wasn’t them who
                defined it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But, that’s almost certainly not true. Even though these societies believe the imaginary exists
                outside of them, in reality it was them who defined it, and in this same way it is only them who can
                change it.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="defining-autonomy"&gt;Defining autonomy&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If people know that it’s them who set the rules, would they adhere to them?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A negative answer is widely believed. Dostoevsky’s characters in &lt;em&gt;The Brothers
                Karamazov&lt;/em&gt; say if there is no god, everything is permitted, meaning that people only contain
                their behaviour because of fear of someone above them, a &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_dialectic"&gt;master&lt;/a&gt;
                figure.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Cornelius defines &lt;em&gt;autonomy&lt;/em&gt; as the ability to be able to set one’s own
                laws. He completely rejects Dostoevsky’s argument and claims that it is not only feasible but also of
                utmost importance, for a society to set their own laws.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To further clarify the term and respond to certain critique, following no rules and acting
                in-the-moment is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; autonomy. Autonomy still includes predefined rules. The
                difference is that these rules are consciously determined by the society members, rather than by
                something external to the members.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;An autonomous society is one that is designedly defining its own imaginary. This process of
                defining the imaginary is a constant one. It’s a constant re-definition, and interrogation of
                established values, beliefs, and traditions. This constant re-definition Cornelius describes as a
                tradition in itself. As the custom of frequently questioning the foundations of society.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="autonomy-across-history"&gt;Autonomy across history&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Which communities—across the whole human history—were autonomous?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Cornelius says there have been two cases—at least that he knows of, he clarifies—of societies
                questioning their imaginary and &lt;a
                href="/blog/democracy-is-an-achievement-not-a-recipe/"&gt;achieving&lt;/a&gt; autonomy. The ancient
                Greek society from the 8th c. BC to the 5th c. BC, and the western European society from the Middle Ages
                till today.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Those two societies doubted the traditional viewpoints of the world and asked
                themselves:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;What should the institutions of our society be?&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;What is fair and what is not?&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;What is worth doing?&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;How should we think?&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;What is truth?&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;They consciously answered based on the values they want to have. This is how they set their
                imaginary.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="our-societys-imaginary"&gt;Our society’s imaginary&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This now raises two questions. What is &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; society’s imaginary and do we
                believe it was us who set it?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Capitalism defines a healthy economy as one that’s always growing. Why? Logic says so.
                Capitalism dictates that the control of humanity over the Earth keeps growing. Why? It’s logical, isn’t
                it?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Not really. Even if we indulge ourselves to the argument from a strictly logical point of
                view—economy growing means more technology, means higher quality of life—we come to a dead
                end.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;For example, why is higher life quality a thing to want? Ignoring the moral nihilism of this
                argument and looking at it purely rationally, the universe will eventually die, permeating a certain
                lack of logic purpose. Earth will also be dead long before that.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A utilitarian approach would say “anything to lessen human suffering”, but does economy growth
                translate to less human suffering? Maybe if we suffer we can reach a higher state of being, a
                consequentialist would say. But we don’t know that, and logic has to stop there. Even if we knew, strict
                logic wouldn’t justify a higher state of being.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Going back even further, why does technology lead to higher life quality? GDP being decoupled
                from human life wellbeing is now &lt;a
                href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2014/05/growing-disconnect-gdp-wellbeing/"&gt;almost common
                knowledge&lt;/a&gt;. GDP growth actively lowering our wellbeing is also generally accepted;
                deforestation, &lt;a
                href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/c-change/news/fossil-fuel-air-pollution-responsible-for-1-in-5-deaths-worldwide/"&gt;air
                pollution&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/04/1036851"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;, et
                alia, all contribute to this wellbeing undoing.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;So: why grow?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="trigger-for-change"&gt;Trigger for change&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Let’s re-examine the claim that it is logic that shows us that we need to keep growing our
                economy. It is possible to see logic as a tool or a process, but here—at least on a first level—we
                consider logic an entity in itself that dictates something, our imaginary. Regardless, though. One who
                makes the claim of logic believes that it was &lt;em&gt;something else&lt;/em&gt; that defined our
                imaginary. They believe that it was logic that defined it, not us.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Following this claim, logic is the originator of our imaginary and logic does not bend to
                anything. Since we cannot change logic, we cannot change our imaginary, and subsequently we cannot
                change the foundations of our own society.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Cornelius implied in 1984 that we are indeed part of a society that questions our imaginary.
                Alas, as the reader might have guessed, I’m not sure that’s still true. Mostly because, when I tell
                people that it can be our choice to stop growing our economy they look at me in utmost perplexity. It
                feels that’s how one would be looked at if they said to an Old Testament Jewish person that the Torah is
                not fair. But, the conversation does exist on some level. Maybe that’s what Cornelius meant, that some
                level is enough.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;During these COVID years, several things previously not in focus came into it. One example is
                nurses. There is virtually no one that believes that nurses are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; underpaid or
                undervalued. Their work is not just essential but of vital importance. So why are they underpaid and
                undervalued? The answer is silly. It's because we must not intervene in the market on this level—yet we
                can intervene with furlough and stimulus checks, and &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailout#Examples"&gt;bank bailouts&lt;/a&gt; for that
                matter.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A non-silly society, instead, would assert their ownership over its bedrock—the imaginary—and
                restore rudimentary justice by making the nurses’ compensation fair.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Consider this text a call to be non-silly. Of course, not just for nurses. Let’s be non-silly
                all together, and realise that it is only us who can change what we consider true and fair, how we
                should think, and what’s worth doing.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Consider this is a call to rebuild the ideological substratum of our society.&lt;/p&gt;

            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/visually-and-programmatically-simple-backend-analytics/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Once, I set out to write backend-based analytics for &lt;a
                href="https://mataroa.blog/"&gt;mataroa.blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It was terrible. Slow, complex, ugly. Then, I rewrote it. It turned out great. I really like
                its simplicity and elegance.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is where I explain how.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Mataroa is written in Python using Django, and the following snippets are from commit hash
                &lt;a
                href="https://git.sr.ht/~sirodoht/mataroa/tree/7b6e5da84b8a93e9af37545b16a6ec2f874be97e"&gt;7b6e5da84b8a93e9af37545b16a6ec2f874be97e&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="django-model"&gt;Django Model&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;div style="background: #fdf6e3;"&gt;&lt;pre style=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #859900;"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #268bd2;"&gt;Analytic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;(models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;Model):&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;ForeignKey(Post,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;on_delete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;CASCADE)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;created_at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;DateTimeField(auto_now_add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;referer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;URLField(blank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The above is &lt;a
                href="https://git.sr.ht/~sirodoht/mataroa/tree/7b6e5da84b8a93e9af37545b16a6ec2f874be97e/item/main/models.py#L209"&gt;the
                model&lt;/a&gt; that stores the analytics. It's a single model, with a foreign key to post. Each model
                object, which is a table row, is one visit for one particular post.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As far as deletion strategies, we opt for cascade, as we don't want to have analytics of a post
                that has been deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;created_at&lt;/code&gt; field / column is the timestamp of when the visit was
                registered. We enable &lt;code&gt;auto_now_add&lt;/code&gt;, which essentially fills the timestamp in
                when the object is created. Exactly the purpose of a &lt;code&gt;created_at&lt;/code&gt;
                column.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Final field, the &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer#Etymology"&gt;misspelled&lt;/a&gt;
                &lt;code&gt;referer&lt;/code&gt;. I considered omitting it, in the name of no tracking. Eventually, I
                decided it's ok because of minimal tracking capabilities as the IP is not logged.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="logging-analytics"&gt;Logging analytics&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To log a new analytic we &lt;a
                href="https://git.sr.ht/~sirodoht/mataroa/tree/7b6e5da84b8a93e9af37545b16a6ec2f874be97e/item/main/views.py#L201"&gt;inject
                this&lt;/a&gt; into the post detail view:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div style="background: #fdf6e3;"&gt;&lt;pre style=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;referer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;

                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;META[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;quot;HTTP_REFERER&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;Analytic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:

                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;create(post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #268bd2;"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:

                &lt;p&gt;It includes a check for the referer HTTP header. If it exists, add it. If not, keep it
                &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;. Also, in case of the user being logged in, we do not log a

                &lt;p&gt;Showing the analytics to the user was the funnest part of this feature. Usually, one chooses a
                chart JavaScript library and feeds the data from a JSON endpoint. But, not at mataroa! To enjoy true
                craftsmanship, I wrote &lt;a

                {% endfor %}
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #268bd2;"&gt;svg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;It's a bit complex. Let's break it down.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The first line defines the svg object in a container of 500px width and 192px height:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div style="background: #fdf6e3;"&gt;&lt;pre style=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #268bd2;"&gt;svg&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;quot;1.1&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;viewBox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;quot;0 0 500
                192&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;xmlns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Then, we define a white background for the dates labels. This should be below the actual
                analytics graph:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div style="background: #fdf6e3;"&gt;&lt;pre style=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #268bd2;"&gt;rect&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;quot;100&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;quot;100&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;quot;500&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;quot;fill:
                #fff;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #268bd2;"&gt;rect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Then, we do a loop on each analytic object. Each object represents the number of visits per
                day. It contains a rectangle, which is the column, and then the number of visits, and the date. Each
                &lt;code&gt;post_analytics&lt;/code&gt; item contains:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;x_offset&lt;/code&gt;: How right the column (rectangle) will be.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;negative_count_percent&lt;/code&gt;: How much down each column (rectangle) will
                be.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;count_percent&lt;/code&gt;: The max height for a column is 100px. The height is
                the percentage ratio of this visit divided by the number of visits of the day of the most visits (i.e.
                most analytics).&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt;: The absolute number of visits for this day, for this post. A
                positive integer.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We use the above to create the column of the graph. Then, we create labels below each column,
                which are read vertically.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The first &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; element is the number of visits, and the second is the
                date. Positioning in this case is stacked. If something exists in &lt;code&gt;x = 0&lt;/code&gt;, and
                has width 9 pixels, the next one will start from &lt;code&gt;x = 10&lt;/code&gt; onwards. But, in our
                case, we want to have a little bit of margin too. This is the reason we use the Django template filter
                &lt;code&gt;add:'9'&lt;/code&gt;. We want to move the next text a further 9px to the right.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;For the date element, we also do a 90° rotation so that each line fits in the 9px width of a
                single column. And, the fixed point, around which the whole line turns, is the middle. We define this
                with the property:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div style="background: #fdf6e3;"&gt;&lt;pre style=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;dominant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;baseline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;quot;middle&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;We, now, have a minimal, beautiful (IMHO at least), and more importantly simple graph that
                visually takes across the information we want. All that with a few hundred bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="post-analytics.png" src="/images/d9bc8d04.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="calculating-analytics"&gt;Calculating analytics&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The last piece of the puzzle is how we &lt;a
                href="https://git.sr.ht/~sirodoht/mataroa/tree/7b6e5da84b8a93e9af37545b16a6ec2f874be97e/item/main/views.py#L653"&gt;generate
                the view variables&lt;/a&gt; that we pass on to the front-end.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It might be obvious that we need to do some SQL aggregations. I was quite convinced that I
                would end up with raw SQL for this one, but the beautifully designed Django ORM did not fail to deliver
                once again.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;By utilising features such as &lt;code&gt;annotate&lt;/code&gt; and
                &lt;code&gt;Count&lt;/code&gt;, I managed to get the same performance with what I'd write as raw
                SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We get the full data of 25 days of analytics for one post like so:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div style="background: #fdf6e3;"&gt;&lt;pre style=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;date_25d_ago&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;timezone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;now()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;date()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span
                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;timedelta(days&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;day_counts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:

                #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;Analytic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;objects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;filter(&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #268bd2;"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:

                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;created_at__gt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;date_25d_ago&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;values(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;quot;created_at&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;annotate(Count(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Then, we needed to transform the above, so that we have all the required numbers to draw the
                SVG shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;First, we transform the counts for each day into a dictionary with date as key. At the same
                loop, we find the day with the most analytics. We want to use this max number of visits as the 100%
                column of our graph.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div style="background: #fdf6e3;"&gt;&lt;pre style=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;count_per_day&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;defaultdict(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #268bd2;"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;highest_day_count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #859900;"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #859900;"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;day_counts:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;count_per_day[item[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;quot;created_at&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;date()]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;item[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;quot;id__count&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;# find day with the most analytics counts (i.e. visits)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #859900;"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;highest_day_count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;count_per_day[item[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;quot;created_at&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;date()]:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;highest_day_count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;count_per_day[item[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;quot;created_at&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;date()]&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Then, we calculate the counts and percentages we need for each day.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;We normalise each analytics count as a percentage.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;If it's 0, we re-write to 1px, so that it's visible in the graph.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Each column has 18px width, plus 1px on each side as margin.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;div style="background: #fdf6e3;"&gt;&lt;pre style=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;current_date&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;timezone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;now()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;date()&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #859900;"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;date_25d_ago&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;current_date:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;# normalize day count to percentage for svg drawing&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;count_percent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;# keep lowest value to 1 so as it&amp;#39;s visible&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #859900;"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;highest_day_count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span
                style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #859900;"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;count_per_day[current_date]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:

                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;count_percent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;count_per_day[current_date]&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;highest_day_count&lt;/span&gt;

                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;quot;count_percent&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:

                &lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;quot;negative_count_percent&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span
                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;count_percent,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;current_date&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;current_date&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span
                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;timedelta(days&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;current_x_offset&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;negative_count_percent&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;100 -
                count_percent&lt;/code&gt;, because the SVG positions stars counting from above. So, for example, if our
                column is 10px tall, we want it to start from 90px down, so that it finishes at 100px (as it has 10px
                height). In this way, every column's lower edge is aligned.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="referers"&gt;Referers&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We aim for simplicity as far as the referers are concerned, too. We &lt;a

                &lt;p&gt;I remember looking at a very similar graph in &lt;a

                primary source of inspiration. Along with the conviction that &lt;a
                href="https://sive.rs/polut"&gt;writing SVG myself&lt;/a&gt; is not illogical.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;PS. Since writing this post, referrer logging has been removed from mataroa, following the
                change of the default referrer policy by &lt;a

            <title>Letter from prison</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/letter-from-prison/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear stranger,&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Tell me your thoughts. Are things actually bad or is it just me?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Everybody says this is normal. This is what is supposed to happen. Yet it doesn’t feel normal.
                It feels like slavery. I am a slave. Worse than a slave. A slave both of body and of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Everyday, I wake up early. Too early, if you ask me. Starting 8am until 2pm I have work. We get
                10-minute breaks every hour, yet we can’t really do anything during those 10 minutes. It’s only allowed
                to go out in the gated yard. They say it’s for our protection.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is not a job one can quit. Nor one can change. There is no pay for this job. They say the
                work itself will pay in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;During work time we all have to do what they tell us. That’s fine, I can deal with it. The
                problem is we also have to &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; what they tell us. &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is
                what's killing me.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We are micromanaged. Under constant supervision at all times. The supervisor asks us things.
                This is how they check if we are thinking the things they tell us. They say it’s for our own
                good.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We’re not allowed to collaborate for the work. It’s the same work for everyone, but everyone
                has to do it for themselves. They monitor if we collaborate and if we do then our work is annulled. They
                say it’s for justice.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Some special times we have to collaborate. Then the work is opposite. One is forced to
                collaborate, even with workers they don’t like. They say it's for society.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In comparison to my coworkers, I have it pretty good. I can focus on the thinking material they
                ask us and I’m pretty good at the work. Also, I’m terrified when they yell at us. So I only do the
                things they tell us to do. I don’t even dare to think to do anything else. The cost-benefit analysis was
                clear: such fear and shame is too much to bear. Admittedly, I'm a coward.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Some workers can’t take the pressure. They either abuse other workers or don’t do the work and
                the thinking. It usually ends bad. Usually yelling. I don’t mind it so much. Apart from my constantly
                elevated heartbeat, it also means that we get to have a few seconds off-thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The workers are divided in groups by the year we were born. The thinking and the work are also
                divided by year. If you’re really bad at the work, then you have to do a whole year’s work again. I had
                some coworkers that went through that. It’s pretty rare though.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Some special times, things get extra ugly. Maybe a coworker snaps hard and attacks another
                coworker. Sometimes the supervisors snap. They can’t take the supervising pressure, or just some other
                random thing in their lives, who knows. They won’t tell &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;. They don’t tell us much
                in general; only what we are allowed to know. Only what’s relevant to the sanctioned work.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If during work, one needs to go to the bathroom, they have to ask for permission. Sometimes the
                supervisors decline. Maybe because of important thinking, or just too many people went to the bathroom.
                There might be a quota.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Walking around your desk or getting up for a stretch is strictly prohibited. These are
                activities for break time only.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Our lunch break is 20 minutes. We can’t do much. We can’t cook. We have to either buy from the
                official store inside the enclave or bring food from home. But we can’t microwave it or
                something.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;At 2pm the bell rings and the guard opens the gates. This is when we get to go home. Home is
                much better. Much more relaxed, but we still have to do work. It takes a few hours. After that, we are
                free. Or at least that's what they say.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;How can one be free, if the only thing they can control in their life is a few hours per day?
                Even more, when they have no money to spend.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Slaves get limited free time per day. It is slaves that do not get paid for work. It is slaves
                that cannot quit.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Yet slaves are free to at least dream of freedom. They are free to think of it. Only a slave of
                mind is not. What could be worse than that?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It was the citizens of &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four"&gt;Oceania&lt;/a&gt; that had their thoughts
                controlled and it was with the same techniques: prescribed information to consume, defined language to
                talk, constant fear of punishment by the authority.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;So, how could we ever expect even a remotely balanced person to come out of school?&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Against BTC: The strong state collapse</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/against-btc-the-strong-state-collapse/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;In case you’ve been living under a rock there is a thing called Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is a digital currency, which many people are very excited about. In this post I hope to
                explain to you, dear reader, why it is exciting and why it’s actually lame.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The technology behind Bitcoin and especially other cryptocurrencies is seriously
                cool.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It was a warm summer evening in Tokyo when the legendary &lt;a
                href="/blog/on-satoshi/"&gt;genius of&lt;/a&gt; Satoshi Nakamoto finally figured out how we can build
                digital currencies without trusted third parties. This had been an ultimate challenge for a while. We
                couldn’t figure out how to do it so that no one needs to trust any one and still have transactions and
                money online. But, Satoshi finally figured it out. What a legend.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Medias script: I may have made up the part that says it was a warm summer evening in
                Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="bitcoin-is-a-store-of-value"&gt;Bitcoin is a store of value&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Many BTC proponents say that BTC is a store of value. When I first read that I thought “well,
                everything is a store of value; EUR, USD, my car, all of them store value”.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;That’s not what the BTC people mean, though. They mean store as in permanent store. What’s the
                point of money if one is not spending them but permanently storing them? Good question.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;There is a problem that comes up if one has more than a few months worth of money. Their
                location. In the bank, of course, someone with less money would say. In their pocket as cash, someone
                with even less money would say.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;That, with which both poor and rich people agree, is: fuck banks.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Banks can decide that they don’t allow you access to your funds just because. Governments can
                make banks do that. What if we had a way to store money and 100% control it?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Gold is valuable, tradable, and can be 100% owned—I can just store it in my basement. If the
                banks don’t like me (or if they collapse, or if someone attempts a coup, or if civilisation collapses),
                one thing is for sure: I &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; my money and I’m still free and independent to buy
                stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Now we’re getting somewhere. There is only one problem with gold. It’s heavy to move around.
                What if we had gold, but digital? Enter Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is virtual gold; it’s supposed to be hard to move around—in a way. For instance,
                Bitcoin has high fees (currently $20), so if you want to transfer Bitcoin (not matter how much!) you
                have to pay an extra $20.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Well, that’s stupid, one could say. The universal hate for banks is partly because they make us
                pay fees, and supposedly high-tech Bitcoin also has fees? So, if I want to eat a burger that costs $10,
                I’d have to pay $30. Madness.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Indeed it is. But: Bitcoin is for value storage, not transfer. Maybe billionaires don’t care,
                they can hide around the whole globe. But what about a millionaire, or a thousandaire? They could hide,
                but they may also be hunted by tax offices. Maybe one day said tax offices will find their hidden funds
                and eradicate them. It would be nice to actually control them.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="bitcoin-will-not-help-people-who-actually-need-help"&gt;Bitcoin will not help people who
                actually need help&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In addition to banks, the rich and the poor might actually agree to “fuck governments”,
                too.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Let’s imagine a future potential Bitcoin-enabled socioeconomic landscape. The price of Bitcoin
                is now $2.6 million. Governments ask tax residents to declare all their wallet addresses. Bitcoin mixers
                are not legal. Power may now mean having access to the illegal ones. There are now two outcomes. Either
                we give up on taxes, or we find a way to at least monitor (if not control) the Bitcoin
                network.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the first case, the concept of the strong state dies. At least I can’t see how it couldn’t.
                No taxes means no public schools, no free universal healthcare, no furlough when the next pandemic
                comes, and generally no control of the economy whatsoever. &lt;em&gt;We’ll finally be
                free!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the second case, Bitcoin is just another currency, just like USD and EUR. Central banks
                control it, ministries decide what to do with it, and the market can be as free as the government
                allows. Essentially the same thing we have now.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Is there a third case? Maybe people decide they want strong states and declare all their income
                themselves. Or maybe BTC remains a non-mainstream thing. Or maybe something more radical happens, which
                I cannot predict.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To conclude with the future cases, I mostly see the following. Those who are super rich remain
                super rich. Those who are generally well off may become super rich. And those who are poor or really
                poor will remain as such—if not worse.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="bitcoin-does-not-help-people-who-actually-need-help-now"&gt;Bitcoin does not help people who
                actually need help now&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To make the present case of Bitcoin worse: I can’t pay either Amazon or the supermarket with
                Bitcoin; it’s much slower than the current financial systems; it’s much less secure and does not forgive
                mistakes; it has laughably high fees; and it contributes significantly to global warming. All that in
                order to benefit from 100% controlling our money which we can’t spend directly but only store
                it.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I acknowledge that Bitcoin becoming more expensive is a reason to buy. “Investing” in the idea
                that more people will be convinced to be bank-independent. But I’m not interested in anything short
                term, or even long term gains if those are not backed by value in essence. Unless we can figure out how
                Bitcoin can &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; contribute to the world society, I will continue to denounce
                it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Book: For the Love of Men by Liz Plank</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/book-for-the-love-of-men-by-liz-plank/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across &lt;a href="http://www.elizabethplank.com/book"&gt;For the Love of
                Men&lt;/a&gt; by Liz Plank as a possible gift, and I initially started flipping through with no intent
                to read the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The blurb starts with:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A nonfiction investigation into masculinity, &lt;strong&gt;For the Love of Men&lt;/strong&gt;
                provides &lt;em&gt;actionable steps for how to be a man in the modern world&lt;/em&gt; while also
                exploring how being a man has evolved.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I'd love to listen to some actionable steps by a woman! It's easy enough to know what not to
                do, but a bit harder of what one is supposed to do. Particularly, in the dating scene, which is the
                topic the book starts with.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The first response I get on what a man should do is a question. Why assume all women like the
                same behaviour by men? Some women prefer traditionally manly men, while others fancy modern masculine
                ones. While I used to be under the impression that it was traditional masculinity that was eclipsing,
                lately I've been noticing the opposite. For instance, I have many straight women friends who would not
                go on a second date if the man splits the bill on the first. Actually, I have zero women friends who
                wouldn't like it if the man pays on a date.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In any case, these thoughts had helped me solidify the correct course of action. A man does
                what they think is best, and, inevitably, they connect with women who prefer the same things. Which, I
                guess, is what actually happens in practice. Hooray?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="do-women-like-traditionally-manly-men"&gt;Do women like traditionally manly men?&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In Chapter 7 of the book, &lt;em&gt;The Great Suppression&lt;/em&gt;, Liz talks with &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomi_Lahren"&gt;Tomi Lahren&lt;/a&gt; who asked:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Is it just me, or have men gotten really soft these days?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;She continued—quoting from &lt;a
                href="https://www.intellectualtakeout.org/blog/female-reporter-asks-it-just-me-or-have-men-gotten-really-soft/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This has nothing to do with sexuality. It has to do with the helplessness of today's young men.
                It seems few can change a light bulb let alone fix a flat tire or change oil, and that makes for pretty
                slim pickings for the females out there looking for a match.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Jewellery is all but dead, and so is manliness. And by the way, wearing a flannel shirt and
                having a beard doesn't make you a man if you still can't change a tire and are scared of the
                dark.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It seems like millennial men either don't have jobs or are still using their parents' credit
                cards to buy us drinks at the bar...&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;So whose fault is it? Is it our fault, ladies? Are we getting too strong? Nah, I don't buy
                that. See, a real man knows how to handle a strong woman, so this isn't our problem. Maybe it's the way
                boys are raised these days: fatherless homes and no male role models. It's hard to learn how to be a man
                with no man around.”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Please teach your sons to be men, because the women of the world are tired of the
                boys.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Right—an interesting viewpoint, nonetheless. The author takes this as an example to explore
                traditional masculinity, and with it being the one that struck me as the most intriguing, I will use it
                to illustrate some of the core ideas of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Continuing with this encounter, a most interesting bit is when Tomi's friend, John, is asked by
                Liz to define the term he used: "new-age man".&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If we want to boil it down to fashion, we could go that route: skinny jeans, very metrosexual,
                very effeminate. It's cool if you want to do that; if that's your thing, do your thing; be happy with
                it. But don't you dare turn around and demonize my class of people that want to be like the old-school
                type of men. Not criticizing or belittling women, but just being the old-school alpha male that “if you
                come near my woman or you insult her, I'm going to knock your teeth down your throat.”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Now, we can answer whether we should "Hooray" that men and women with the same ideas of
                masculinity connect with each other. The answer is "Not hooray"; and the reason is that traditional
                masculinity is toxic and sexist.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="whats-the-problem-with-old-school-men"&gt;What's the problem with old-school men?&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Throughout the book, Liz, in addition to noticing a lack of positive masculinity, also
                identifies all the many ways traditional masculinity fails. The book explores this across various
                countries, with a focus on North America (which is the author's origin).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Traditional masculinity says that the man is the provider. The one who works and brings the
                money. The woman is the carer, the person who stays at home and takes care of the house and the
                children.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;At some point, Liz asks John, what would happen if he weren't able to fulfil the man role. What
                if he broke his leg or had some other more permanent issue? John replied:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The way I was raised, no, I could never be a stay-at-home father. I'd have to go out and work.
                I can't fathom the idea of a woman supporting me. It's just I want to take care of her; that's how it
                should be.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Liz eventually tells us what would happen by looking at what has happened. Men are ashamed of
                not being able to provide and thus be properly manly. They can't deal with this shame, and thus
                self-destruct by becoming abusive—to themselves too. How frequent, of a movie cliché, the alcoholic or
                violent father, is?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;And this is how the book answers to John's warning on why the old-school type of men are
                demonised. Because this type of masculinity leads to harmfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Eventually, the author also voices an opinion on dating. Liz talks about the detrimental
                effects of letting men pay. It's nice to make the &lt;em&gt;benevolent sexist&lt;/em&gt; gestures such
                as the man paying or bringing gifts; but we should be aware of the potential underlying dangers that
                come with it. Why do some men insist on paying even when women reject the offer? What do men gain out of
                paying for the date? Food for thought.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="traditional-masculinity-kills-men-too"&gt;Traditional masculinity kills men too&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;One of the main insights of the book is how traditional masculinity is excessively damaging to
                men too. Indicatively, across the world, it is women who have longer expected lifetimes. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The books says three factors of traditional masculinity play a major role: work, risk,
                doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Working is a way for men to demonstrate their manliness. Especially with tough jobs, e.g.
                mining. Dustin White, a coal miner's son, whose father died of cancer, speaks out about how mining
                killed his father and the need for change in the industry. In response, the miners who die of cancer,
                shout at him "where's your dress?". Of course, it is a hero man's, a provider's job to die working. They
                probably don't agree it would be better to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; die.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Risk taking is also core to the art of manliness. Liz starts with an example, in 2017, when
                &lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/60195-trump-stares-at-solar-eclipse-no-glasses.html"&gt;Donald
                Trump stared&lt;/a&gt; into the solar eclipse without sunglasses. It was called, &lt;a
                href="https://www.thewrap.com/tucker-carlson-trump-sun/"&gt;by Tucker Carlson&lt;/a&gt;, "the most
                impressive thing any president’s ever done". Maybe jokingly—maybe not; Tucker though is definitely an
                advocate of Donald's.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Finally, not going to the doctor, is also characteristic of men. We all know men are tough and
                they don't need to go to the doctor, so there is nothing else to say here—except, maybe, that health
                care providers have also been convinced by this ideology, and thus they don't need to cure men as well
                as non-men. It becomes even more interesting when one looks into black men. Liz says:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ol&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;[...] Half of white medical students believe false racialized myths like that black people’s
                bodies are stronger, black people’s skin is thicker, their nerve endings are less sensitive than whites’
                and black people’s blood coagulates more quickly (none of which are true).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Liz continues with male suicide data, and ends the chapter with:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;[...] Data shows that gender equality may in fact be an unsuspecting antidote to male suicide,
                because women’s empowerment may protect men from economic shocks.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="the-author-liz-plank"&gt;The author: Liz Plank&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Just before I started reading the book, I came across this tweet by Liz:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Can every woman who sees this change their handles to reflect their credentials?
                – &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a
                href="https://twitter.com/feministabulous/status/1338875503789432840"&gt;@feministabulous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;She meant, add your &lt;code&gt;MSc&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;PhD&lt;/code&gt; title like
                her: &lt;em&gt;Liz Plank, MSc. phD in adhd &amp;amp; depression&lt;/em&gt;. There were some responses
                which were lots of fun, e.g. &lt;em&gt;RaKell, the inappropriate (Sworn Enemy of Rufus!)&lt;/em&gt; or
                &lt;em&gt;SheilaW, Girl Friday Extraordinaire&lt;/em&gt;. The responses even acquired further &lt;a
                href="https://twitchy.com/samj-3930/2020/12/15/oh-honey-no-msnbcs-liz-plank-asking-every-woman-to-change-twitter-handles-to-reflect-their-credentials-does-not-go-well-like-at-all/"&gt;non-Twitter
                commentary&lt;/a&gt;. Truth to be told, it was mostly women who identify as conservatives (i.e. enemies
                of Liz's) that responded like that.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Liz's Twitter profile is also interesting. She's &lt;a
                href="https://twitter.com/feministabulous"&gt;@feministabulous&lt;/a&gt; and her bio reads:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I cherish women.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I didn't get it.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I kept on reading the book, though, as it was very enticing. Across the pages, written by a
                scientist, PhD holder, there are some unexpected expressions. For instance, an excerpt from Chapter 10,
                &lt;em&gt;The Mancession&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Although some politicians have instructed men to blame women or immigrants, they should be
                blaming robots: they’re the ones taking men’s jobs. The United States reverting back to being mainly a
                manufacturing economy is as unlikely as One Direction getting back together. &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Apparently, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Direction"&gt;One Direction&lt;/a&gt;
                (an English-Irish pop boy band—just in case someone doesn't know) are on indefinite hiatus since
                2016.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Or, from Chapter 7, &lt;em&gt;The Great Suppression&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;There’s a phenomenon called benevolent sexism, and there’s a likelihood you’ve participated in
                it before. I have a master’s degree in gender studies and heck, I do it all the time. Benevolent sexism
                is sort of like the Macarena: you don’t remember when you learned it, but for some reason you’re really
                good at it.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Or, from Chapter 9, &lt;em&gt;Waffles Are His Love Language&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Same-sex couples tend to split the childcare and the handling of sick kids evenly, while for
                straight couples, women were more likely to take on those tasks. What was the secret to this chore
                utopia? Talking. Apparently, when gender isn’t a determining factor, couples are forced to (gasp!)
                discuss (gasp!) what works best instead of relying on obsolete gender stereotypes that we’ve kept around
                for no good apparent reason.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is the chapter about men and parenting, where she also talks about her father and how he
                would make waffles every Sunday, as a perennial ritual while she was growing up.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;When my mother became very concerned with the calories we were all ingesting, he replaced
                butter with canola oil, but just half the oil because it made the waffles “too droopy,” he would explain
                in the same way a scientist would explain how he created the cure for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Liz is fun, and writes in a fun manner too.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;After finishing the book, I now I get Liz, and the why of her fun-ness. I think at least. It's
                optimism; a result of a loving childhood plus the encounter of acute toxicity in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, it is a news channel she works for, not the serious academia.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="epilogue"&gt;Epilogue&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Needless to say, highly recommended. I really liked this book and it provided brilliant
                insights on how both men and women perceive gender.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In an attempt to be more objective, no actionable steps (promised in the blurb) are really
                given, and there isn't really a new vision offered, per se. Regardless, a great piece of nonfiction
                publication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>The ideal blog platform</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/the-ideal-blog-platform/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress, Tumblr, Blogger, Medium, Ghost. Posthaven, Svbtle, Write.as.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Blogging. The most elegant and natural process of idea diffusion on the web—since its infancy.
                Started barebones; developed massively; evolving continuously.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I’m excited about the next step. Lately, in my social bubble of technology and startups, I
                notice a revisited focus to simplicity and minimalism. It’s probably part of a constant cycle,
                regardless, now it exists. In addition to that, there is a much wider, across the world, appreciation
                for controlling one’s data.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Towards expressing this second part, it’s great if a blogging platform is open source. It’s
                also a good idea for a blogging web citizen to control their web estate: the blog domain. One can do
                that with a lot of blog platforms. To account for simplicity and minimalism, though, the most &lt;a
                href="https://sive.rs/polut"&gt;unwasteful&lt;/a&gt; and efficient way to run one’s blog is to serve
                static HTML. That is, to utilise a static site generator, rather than running a backend, a database, and
                all that entails. It’s a much simpler, more efficient, more elegant, and significantly faster way of web
                existence.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="self-hosted-blogs"&gt;Self hosted blogs&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;How to empower people to create their own self-hosted blog? There are some ideas. Drew instated
                the &lt;a href="https://drewdevault.com/make-a-blog"&gt;Make a blog&lt;/a&gt; initiative. Stavros made
                the &lt;a href="https://quicksite.stavros.io/"&gt;Quick Site&lt;/a&gt; guide. My idea was &lt;a
                href="https://mataroa.blog/"&gt;mataroa.blog&lt;/a&gt;, a blogging platform that makes it easy to get
                off it.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;There is a certain difficulty in starting to blog. It is inspiration that lights the fire, and
                inspiration is not on tap. I remember when I wanted to start a blog or write an article, I would dive
                into all the technicalities (re-styling, updating, refactoring, etc) and eventually not write
                anything.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://mataroa.blog/"&gt;Mataroa.blog&lt;/a&gt; is designed for when inspiration
                comes. This is the time to just write, focus on the essence and get the words out. When done writing,
                there is lots of uninspired time to think about the best way to design, rework, speed up your blog.
                Mataroa enables one to do that by having export as a first-class feature. One can export into simple
                markdown text files, or &lt;a href="https://www.getzola.org/"&gt;Zola&lt;/a&gt; sources, or &lt;a
                href="https://gohugo.io/"&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; sources with a single click. One can also set a redirect
                domain, so that their mataroa blog automatically redirects to a new blog home.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The greatest benefit of blogging platforms is that you can start writing immediately. No domain
                decisions, no servers, no coding. This comes at a cost, though: potential lock-in.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To account for this and the aforementioned need for simplicity, the features I’d like to see in
                an ideal blog platform are:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;absolutely no vendor lock-in&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;it even helps you get off it&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;open source&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;simple&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;minimal&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;fast&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;focus on the essence&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;follow open standards such as RSS&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://mataroa.blog/"&gt;Mataroa.blog&lt;/a&gt; is designed with all these in
                mind.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But, actually, I don’t want to sell mataroa to you; as much as I want to convince you on the
                merits of self-hosted personal blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The foundational platform of the web—the web itself—is more democratic than any medium (wink)
                has ever been—at least until now.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Let’s build directly on it without intermediate layers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="addendum-on-hosting"&gt;Addendum on hosting&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;During the last 10 years of massive web centralisation, there have been instances when the
                internet giants fall. AWS, Google, Cloudflare—bad days exist for them too.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It’s funny to see your blog up when Google is down. Especially when the only reason is the
                choice of an indie cloud/server/hosting provider&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref"
                href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I used to depend on EC2 for servers, Netlify for CDN, Google
                for fonts, other CDNs for JavaScript libraries. Now, this blog loads fully from a single server with
                just two small requests, one HTML and one CSS file. So much fun!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
                &lt;hr&gt;
                &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I have found &lt;a href="https://www.hetzner.com/"&gt;Hetzner&lt;/a&gt; to be pretty reliable
                during the last couple of years. I think it’s a good recommendation, though, I’m sure they have bad days
                too.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the
                text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ol&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;</description>

            <title>Perceived age velocity. Or: Why every year is getting shorter</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/perceived-age-velocity-or-why-every-year-is-getting-shorter/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Time is scary.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Everybody is afraid they will grow old. Even if death was not on the menu, being non-young is
                not fun. Fatigue, fragility, lack of agility.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In this quest of fear facing one could turn to stoicism. One of the arcane techniques of this
                resurgent philosophy is negative visualization. One could imagine they are old and wary and experience
                it in their imagination, which will then—presumably—cause them to make peace with it. &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time.&lt;br&gt;
                – &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pink-floyd-lyrics.com/html/time-dark-lyrics.html"&gt;Pink
                Floyd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But spooky time has another trick. Getting older feels faster &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; one grows
                older. As if the older one gets, the faster time passes. &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is completely expected, a time scientist would say a posteriori. When one is 10 years old,
                a new year would include 1/10th of their memories. When they would be 11 years old, the last year would
                comprise 10%&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
                of their lives. However, when one is 50 years old, a new year would comprise 1/50th, which is 2% of new
                memories when measured in time&lt;sup id="fnref2:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref"
                href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Of course, then, it feels that time speeds up. Every new year
                will always be smaller as the already lived memories will only keep growing. &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Which brings a second negativity to visualise for the stoic response: one should also assume
                that the next year will go by even faster than the previous one.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Wicked.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
                &lt;hr&gt;
                &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Assuming they remember everything since birth.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref"
                href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a
                class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref2:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the
                text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ol&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;</description>

            <title>Direct democracy features of the Swiss kind</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/direct-democracy-features-of-the-swiss-kind/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;There is some colloquy in political discussions that Switzerland has the best kind of
                democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="introducing-the-confederation"&gt;Introducing the Confederation&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Officially the Swiss &lt;em&gt;Confederation&lt;/em&gt;, Switzerland is a federal democracy,
                theoretically, resembling that of the United States&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref"
                href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Instead of states, there are cantons. However, Switzerland, as
                a semi-direct democracy, also has a lot of mechanisms that enable direct democracy. Even though I have
                often invoked the Swiss democracy as worth copying, I was in the dark—until recently—about specific
                details of how the political system works. Except, only, for the famous high frequency of their
                referenda.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Three of the main voting mechanisms in Switzerland that enable directness are:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Mandatory referenda, for important changes, eg. in the constitution.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Legislative referenda, optional, for changing laws passed by the parliament.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Popular initiatives, which are initiated by the people to change the constitution in any
                way.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ol&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It would be great for other western countries to have a higher quality democracy, like the
                Swiss. But, it seems infeasible. Something that would require an unimaginable amount of change both in
                policies and in perception of politics by the people.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="assumptions"&gt;Assumptions&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I’d love to try it, though. Nowadays, I'm under the impression that the vast majority of the
                world’s democracies are spiralling down rather swiftly. But, technology is booming, so what’s wrong? It
                would seem it's not a case of humanity being out of luck and experiencing a one-off event. Rather,
                something is wrong at a foundational level. Is technology not enough to solve all of humanities
                problems?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In addition, by enabling more directness in a democracy, the power is more divided among the
                people, which—in case of dangerous people—makes direct democracy more dangerous, not more
                desirable!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Both the importance of technology and the case of freedom versus safety are philosophical
                discussions out of the scope of this text. Thus, let’s assume:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Technology is of supreme importance.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;We prefer not to distribute power if that means people with an education of lesser quality get
                it.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ol&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="educating-voters"&gt;Educating voters&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Under these assumptions, education and knowledge are the foundational stones of direct
                democracy. For the common people to decide about policies, they need to know about policies. Are Swiss
                people more educated than, say, other western countries? Even so, how much more educated?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I would guess not by that much, that it would justify a complete overturn of who holds the
                political power. To counter for the lack of education and specific knowledge about each referendum, in
                Switzerland, each ballot is accompanied with a handbook. The handbook explains in great detail what each
                vote means. For instance, what cost would each option incur, how would it be covered, what is the
                recommended vote by each level of authority (canton, parliament, municipality), what is the minority’s
                opinion and, of course, why.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;An acceptable way to educate the public on what they vote for, but also an imperfect way. It
                raises many questions. Namely one, how many people do actually bother to vote, given the handbook's
                overhead? &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_in_Switzerland"&gt;According to
                Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, the number has varied since the 1970s between 42% and 50%, with few extreme cases
                going over 60%, such as the matter of Switzerland joining the EU.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Those numbers do sound close to an average election turnout in many western countries, &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout#Trends_of_decreasing_turnout_since_the_1980s"&gt;if
                not worse&lt;/a&gt;. Which raises another interesting question: how do they manage to maintain their
                direct democracy quality (and do they?) given these meagre voter turnouts&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a
                class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="other-features-of-the-system"&gt;Other features of the system&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If we examine the example of a Swiss citizen, who has been living in Zurich since 2000, they
                have had the opportunity to vote in 548 referenda in the last 21 years. With an average of ~1 referenda
                every two weeks, that sounds unreal. How could this work?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;They vote in bulk. They may hold bulk referenda four times every year, voting for ~6 issues
                each time. It makes one wonder how many tricks like that they have devised in order to scale direct
                democracy to 8+ million people&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref"
                href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Among other interesting properties of the Swiss political system is the fact that Switzerland
                has no constitutional court. The power of interpreting the constitution lies again only with the
                people.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But, the most interesting one is probably that there is no single human that is the face and
                embodies the represented power of the Swiss government. There is a Federal Council that is represented
                by seven members, each having one vote. There is also a Federal Chancellor, but they are not important
                at all as they hold no vote of those seven.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I'm inclined to argue that this property of dividing a country’s top executive by seven,
                doesn't even need that much of a perception shift to happen—it's only a policy to be voted for, with no
                (?) negative side effects yet with the distribution-of-power positive main effect.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As I'm reading more and more about all the various mechanics the Swiss have, each one solving
                and improving on the drawback of the previous, my realisation is this: there is no perfect system, of
                course; the decision is which fundamental ideas we want to adopt and build upon.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, the foremost inquiry is: do we want to try something new or is this
                indeed &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_History_and_the_Last_Man"&gt;the end of
                history&lt;/a&gt;? I understand the need to remain with the devil we know, yet, I'm excited to discover
                the one we don't. Only because the fundamental idea of power distribution sounds better than the lack of
                it.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="epilogue"&gt;Epilogue&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Martin Sústrik's blog posts at &lt;a href="https://250bpm.com/"&gt;250bpm&lt;/a&gt; is where
                most of the above findings were found. They were extremely interesting to read, and I recommend them
                especially for the parts that I did not mention. Examples include how the number of popular initiatives
                soared in the 1970s (before that they hadn't figured out how to do them productively!), how they dealt
                and are dealing with their serious problem of immigration, how to face dangerous referenda (read
                Brexit), and one that could be a book of its own: concordance versus competitive democracy (it's in Part
                3).&lt;/p&gt;

                reveals something interesting: &lt;em&gt;"It turns out that about a quarter votes almost every time, a
                quarter almost never, and the rest votes occasionally. That being said, 90% of people have voted at
                least once in the past five years. This suggests that people vote
                selectively."&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to
                footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Here, one could argue, they have actually scaled to 5.2m people (rather than 8.5m), because
                that's the amount of Swiss people eligible to vote. Which is yet another interesting problem: how much
                of a democracy is it, if only ~61% of the population take part? &lt;em&gt;N.B. that in addition to
                expats, I have included ignorant children in this number, too.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a

                &lt;/li&gt;

            <title>How to: Backup a Mastodon instance</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/how-to-backup-a-mastodon-instance/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently started a new Mastodon instance and went through the joy of setting up a
                Mastodon server. It was easier than expected, the process is very streamlined and detailed in the docs:
                &lt;a
                href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/prerequisites/"&gt;https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/prerequisites/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But, of course, the backup process depends on your setup. The docs here, too, are very
                helpful—in the sense of what you need to backup: &lt;a
                href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/backups/"&gt;https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/backups/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;My setup is based on a simple VPS, with AWS S3 for backup storage, and &lt;a
                href="https://healthchecks.io/"&gt;Healthchecks.io&lt;/a&gt; for schedule monitoring. Except for the
                environment secrets, which is just a static file and easily backup-able, the others are postgres, redis,
                and uploaded files.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is the full &lt;code&gt;backup-mastodon.sh&lt;/code&gt; script:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div style="background: #fdf6e3;"&gt;&lt;pre style=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;# postgres&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #268bd2;"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;quot;Postgres...&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
                runuser -l mastodon -c &lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;#39;cd ~ &amp;amp;&amp;amp; pg_dump -Fc
                mastodon_production -f postgres.dump&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
                aws s3 cp /home/mastodon/postgres.dump s3://sirodohtbucket/backup-postgres/&lt;span style="color:
                #859900;"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;date --iso-8601&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;seconds&lt;span style="color: #859900;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;/

                &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;# redis&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #268bd2;"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;quot;Redis...&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
                aws s3 cp /var/lib/redis/dump.rdb s3://sirodohtbucket/backup-redis/&lt;span style="color:
                #859900;"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;date --iso-8601&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;seconds&lt;span style="color: #859900;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;/

                &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;# uploads&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #268bd2;"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;quot;Uploads...&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #268bd2;"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #859900;"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;date --iso-8601&lt;span
                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;seconds&lt;span style="color: #859900;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

                runuser -l mastodon -c &lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;#39;cd ~ &amp;amp;&amp;amp; tar -czvf
                accounts.tar.gz /home/mastodon/live/public/system/accounts/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
                aws s3 cp /home/mastodon/accounts.tar.gz s3://sirodohtbucket/backup-uploads/&lt;span style="color:
                #268bd2;"&gt;$now&lt;/span&gt;/

                runuser -l mastodon -c &lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;#39;cd ~ &amp;amp;&amp;amp; tar -czvf
                media_attachments.tar.gz /home/mastodon/live/public/system/media_attachments/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
                aws s3 cp /home/mastodon/media_attachments.tar.gz s3://sirodohtbucket/backup-uploads/&lt;span
                style="color: #268bd2;"&gt;$now&lt;/span&gt;/

                runuser -l mastodon -c &lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;#39;cd ~ &amp;amp;&amp;amp; tar -czvf
                site_uploads.tar.gz /home/mastodon/live/public/system/site_uploads/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

                aws s3 cp /home/mastodon/site_uploads.tar.gz s3://sirodohtbucket/backup-uploads/&lt;span style="color:
                #268bd2;"&gt;$now&lt;/span&gt;/
                &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;For postgres, we just use &lt;code&gt;pg_dump&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;a
                href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/app-pgdump.html"&gt;postgres custom format&lt;/a&gt;
                &lt;code&gt;-Fc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;For redis, we just copy the periodically disk-written &lt;a
                href="https://redis.io/topics/persistence"&gt;database dump&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;For the uploaded files, we archive three directories &lt;code&gt;accounts/&lt;/code&gt;,
                &lt;code&gt;media_attachments/&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;site_uploads/&lt;/code&gt; and then upload
                them to S3 with the &lt;code&gt;aws s3 copy&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;For all commands we use &lt;code&gt;runuser&lt;/code&gt; so that they run as if the
                &lt;code&gt;mastodon&lt;/code&gt; user is executing them.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Also, we upload them into datetime directories nested in the bucket, with &lt;code&gt;date
                --iso-8601=seconds&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As for the crontab entry, we follow the &lt;a
                href="https://healthchecks.io/docs/bash/"&gt;Healthchecks docs&lt;/a&gt; on the dot:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;0 3 * * * /home/sirodoht/backup-mastodon.sh &amp;amp;&amp;amp; curl -fsS -m 10

            <description>&lt;p&gt;There is—thankfully—&lt;a
                href="https://www.ft.com/content/53fc1c4a-7ca3-4406-b9db-bebf1af9c9b8"&gt;consid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a

                href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691169446/democracy-for-realists)"&gt;quy&lt;/a&gt;
                on the quality of our world’s democracies. People talk about whether democracy is actually a good idea
                while others claim it’s just the &lt;a
                href="https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/opinion/democracy-mercy-public-opinion"&gt;least
                worse&lt;/a&gt;. In this text I will attempt to convince you that democracy is not only a good idea, but
                actually a great one. All this with a transcendental shift in our perception of democracy:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Democracy is not a system; it is an achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="unsystemacy"&gt;Unsystemacy&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We can’t have democracy if we do not &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; in democratic principles. It’s
                like agile when developing software. You can’t switch to agile by adding a standup and a retro—it’s not
                a recipe&lt;sup id="fnref:agile"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref"
                href="#fn:agile"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. You can only be agile if you have the &lt;a
                href="https://agilemanifesto.org/"&gt;agile mindset&lt;/a&gt;. In the same way, you can’t be a democracy
                just by having your leaders elected&lt;sup id="fnref:elected"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref"
                href="#fn:elected"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. You can only have democracy if you include everyone in
                the actual decision making processes. When venturing democracy, there is a constant need for
                self-reflection on whether everyone is actually involved. This requires a continuous, active examination
                of societal processes, an everlasting reworking of the methods of decision making. That's core to the
                democratic mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="recipe-status"&gt;Recipe status&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It's evident in the global society that we view democracy as a set of rules that once applied,
                all societal desires will be aligned and non-zero sum benefits will unequivocally emerge. One piece of
                this evidence is the common remark: &lt;em&gt;democracy has failed us&lt;/em&gt;; or:
                &lt;em&gt;democracy doesn’t work&lt;/em&gt;. But that’s not the case. There is a limit to the range of
                influence of any &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_agency"&gt;social
                structure&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing will force all our interests to be aligned—only our &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_(sociology)"&gt;agency&lt;/a&gt;. If not this, then what's
                left is searching for loopholes in extraneously established laws with the purpose of making one’s life
                easier at the expense of the whole society's betterment.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;That's not to say this is an argument against social structures. On the contrary, it's one in
                favour. The disparity in this text's thesis is that these structures should be created directly from the
                people they are designed to apply to, not from a handful of elected officials.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="against-chain-of-agency"&gt;Against chain of agency&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Democracy, by definition, is when people themselves have the power to make political and
                societal decisions. It was, historically, the &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic#Modern_philosophy"&gt;dialectic antithesis&lt;/a&gt; to
                oligarchy: when power resides with the few. Indirect, or representative democracy, the current prevalent
                version of democracy, is not democracy, but rather an oligarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In representative democracy, politician (i.e. one who discusses and decides on societal issues)
                is a career. Whereas, in democracy, everyone is a politician and is expected to actively engage with any
                societal issues at hand. That is in addition to their job&lt;sup id="fnref:slavery"&gt;&lt;a
                class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:slavery"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Representative democracy politicians aim to convince people to vote for them via superficially
                dramatic campaigns, &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstration_(political)"&gt;rally&lt;/a&gt;-style theatrical
                performances, and by employing fanfare. There are no real societal plans being discussed&lt;sup
                id="fnref:ad hominem"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ad hominem"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
                between the politicians and the people, just statements and ambiguous responses—approval or
                rejection—from the public.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;However, discussion is a core feature of the democratic framework. How can a team make a
                collective decision if there is no discussion on the issue? In other words, how can a people make a
                democratic decision if there are no processes to discuss issues?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Across the whole wide spectrum of actionable politics, in representative democracy a citizen
                makes, on average, two political decision every four years&lt;sup id="fnref:elections"&gt;&lt;a
                class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:elections"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. As mentioned, achieving democracy
                means people exert the governing power. Nevertheless, half a political decision per year is not nearly
                enough for people to be considered actively involved in the decision making process.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="as-essence"&gt;As essence&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Before we argue against the shortcomings of direct democracy, there is a case to be made for
                the essential quality of democracy as a societal framework&lt;sup id="fnref:system"&gt;&lt;a
                class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:system"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Why is democracy important?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proposition 1&lt;/em&gt;: People value autonomy more than life itself. Indications
                are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_or_death"&gt;spread across history&lt;/a&gt;,
                ranging from the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleftheria_i_thanatos"&gt;motto of
                Greece&lt;/a&gt; to the ethos of &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Free_or_Die_(Breaking_Bad)"&gt;Breaking
                Bad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;em&gt;Proposition 2&lt;/em&gt;: Sharing our lives with other people (friends, family, strangers) is
                part of the essence of our humanity.&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;em&gt;Proposition 3&lt;/em&gt;: It follows from 1 and 2 that being autonomous together with other
                people is vital. &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Democracy is the actualisation of this: making collective decisions on how we live.
                Undoubtedly, fundamental. I would go as far as to say that there is no point in life without this sport
                of endeavouring democracy. If not for it, our life would be either an autonomous loneliness or an
                enslaved collectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="in-defence-of"&gt;In defence of&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Let's assume Fred, our imaginary assistant for the demonstration of the argumentative against
                the shortcomings of direct democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Fred: “Well, that’s all nice and stuff, but we can’t have direct democracy because people are
                not well educated to have opinions on significant matters and/or they will make horrible decisions. See
                Brexit, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Fred, allow me to disagree. For one, there are solid arguments to be made in favour of Brexit,
                regardless of Brexiteers basing their vote on the silly ones.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It is true that people will be unknowledgeable on a variety of issues that they will be asked
                to give opinions on. However, during an honest discourse where all voices are given equal ground and are
                heard in the same level, it is an argument of human rationality and aligned interests that people are
                going to behave responsibly&lt;sup id="fnref:expectations"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref"
                href="#fn:expectations"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Another argument to be made here is that there are, and have been through recent history,
                multiple political leaders the intelligence of whom is highly questionable. Yet, we survived. Therefore,
                I have little fear that the consequences of a potential lack of intelligence will be
                destructive.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Finally, freedom is more important than making the best decision—it’s more important than life
                itself, for many! Let people decide for themselves, even if it kills them. How much more different would
                it be from the present, when elected leaders decide for people, and it still kills them&lt;sup
                id="fnref:police"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:police"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Fred: “So you’re saying instead of Trump ordering the police to kill people, people will
                accidentally kill themselves and that’s ok. Great stuff! You know what, direct democracy is never going
                to work because people don’t have time to talk politics all day. Not to mention that many don't even
                care about politics. They have jobs and are busy with their actual life. Direct democracy was only good
                when it was invented, when they had slaves to work the fields, in ancient Athens.”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Come on, Fred, you know the first part is a straw man.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Here's the thing about people's time. All these decisions already &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; part
                of their busy life. Politics and societal issues unavoidably affect everyone and the only other path is
                lack of action—being a puppet while others decide for your life and the civic institutions that
                eventually you, too, will encounter. Is that not a core part of everyone's life? It seems fundamental to
                find the time for it.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;There are many things to say about all this people's busyness and the concept of bullshit jobs
                is one of them. The work ethic that is currently permeating the global society is one that associates
                work with self-worth&lt;sup id="fnref:protestant"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref"
                href="#fn:protestant"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. David Graeber describes &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs"&gt;Bullshit Jobs&lt;/a&gt; as meaningless jobs that
                exist only because it's shameful to not work. Hence, we had to invent jobs such as &lt;em&gt;door
                attendants&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;airline desk staff who calm passengers whose bags do not
                arrive&lt;/em&gt; to keep up with the demand for &lt;em&gt;virtuous suffering&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In regards to the argument of people not being interested in politics, I see that more of an
                aftereffect of the complete disaster that modern politics has been&lt;sup id="fnref:modern
                politics"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:modern politics"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, rather
                than an inherent characteristic of people not concerned about how they live. Ultimately, many may not
                care, but at least those who do will have the capacity to act.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Fred: “Well, you didn’t convince me at all. We have this system for so long now; it's not
                perfect—nothing is—but it's so much better than all the previous ones&lt;sup
                id="fnref:churchill"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:churchill"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
                We're not going to make such an inconsiderate change and abandon it for something evidently not
                working.”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Today, I learned that up until 2006&lt;sup id="fnref:security"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref"
                href="#fn:security"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; one could take &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_transatlantic_aircraft_plot"&gt;liquids on a plane&lt;/a&gt;.
                It sounds like a magical time, but it was only fourteen years ago. Something so established and familiar
                didn’t exist until very recently. The point I want to make is that changes seem scary but only from
                afar. In the end, this world is all about risk taking and &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus#Panta_rhei"&gt;change&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Another point about radical change is technology. It has evolved enormously during the last
                twenty years, not to mention the last hundred. Who could ever imagine in 1920, that humanity would be so
                intimately enmeshed in a global cybernetic network?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Yet, on the other side, how much have our societal and political systems change since then?
                It’s only fitting that a change of an equivalent radical degree is waiting to happen on how our
                societies work.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

                &lt;li id="fn:agile"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;There is some disagreement over this but &lt;a
                href="https://itrevolution.com/agile-conversations/"&gt;here's a book&lt;/a&gt; that expands on agile
                requiring the appropriate mindset.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:agile"

                &lt;li id="fn:elected"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Elected is many times better than not elected, yet still not good enough.&amp;#160;&lt;a

                text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:slavery"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In Ancient Athens, they didn't need to do that since slaves would do everyone's job, for free.
                In the modern world, until robots can do all jobs, I think it’s important that we do both
                products/services and politics.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:slavery"

                &lt;li id="fn:ad hominem"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The worst version of this absence of real discussion is &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem"&gt;attacking the opponent’s credibility&lt;/a&gt;, the
                one of the lowest quality of the techniques of persuasion.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref"

                &lt;p&gt;Two elections, one for the local authority and one for the country-level authority. This is an
                average of western countries, but I assume it can also vary, as I'm not aware of all European political
                systems. Notable exception is Switzerland, in which multiple referendums take place and &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landsgemeinde"&gt;other direct democracy processes&lt;/a&gt; occur

                &lt;p&gt;It is neither accidental nor satisfactory that young smart people allow themselves to become

            <title>A simple CSS ruleset</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/a-simple-css-ruleset/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;The content of this article is a set of 8 rules along with a CSS writer's workflow,
                grown out of developing small web projects. It's designed for simple layouts with minimal JavaScript
                interactiveness, and its top concern is code readability, rather than &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself"&gt;DRY&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="ruleset"&gt;Ruleset&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;h3 id="1-no-preprocessors"&gt;1. No preprocessors&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Using a preprocessor, such as Sass, for a few thousand lines of CSS code is a clear case of
                overengineering. The scope of a project is the most crucial datum for the preprocessor decision, but
                what happens in modern web development is that the preprocessor overhead is downplayed because of the
                omnipresence of the Node.js toolset.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h3 id="2-no-frameworks"&gt;2. No frameworks&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Unless one plans to use every Bootstrap component it's not worth adding 160KB of un-gzipped CSS
                files. In addition to the size tradeoff, the framework buy-in is an important engineering decision as
                one is potentially adding something that they will have to fight either in a case of over-growing it or
                in a case of not understanding how it's designed to be extended.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h3 id="3-yes-css-reset"&gt;3. Yes CSS reset&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Browser implementation inconsistencies&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref"
                href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; are undying. Therefore, while no framework is advised, a CSS
                reset library is. I've been using &lt;a
                href="https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css"&gt;normalize.css&lt;/a&gt; for the last many years with
                no issues.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h3 id="4-no-externally-loaded-fonts"&gt;4. No externally loaded fonts&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Typography is great and fun. In cases of doubt &lt;a
                href="https://practicaltypography.com/"&gt;Practical Typography&lt;/a&gt; provides enlightenment. But
                this is the case against fonts, and especially against Google Fonts&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a
                class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, as the only real contender for free web
                fonts. Our criteria are quality and speed. All OSes have good enough &lt;a
                href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/system-font-stack/"&gt;default fonts&lt;/a&gt;, thus it's not
                worth loading a &lt;em&gt;slightly different&lt;/em&gt; font and introducing yet another third-party
                dependency. But maybe one wants a more-than-slightly different font. Then, my argument is that most
                Google Fonts are not of high quality, and a
                &lt;a href="https://practicaltypography.com/font-basics.html#why-use-professional-fonts"&gt;professional
                font&lt;/a&gt; might be worth buying.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h3 id="5-yes-semantic-html-elements"&gt;5. Yes semantic HTML elements&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element"&gt;Semantic
                HTML&lt;/a&gt; is great. Not only does it enable one to think through the information architecture of
                their layout, but also improves the accessibility of the website.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h3 id="6-yes-css-variables"&gt;6. Yes CSS variables&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties"&gt;CSS
                variables&lt;/a&gt; have good enough &lt;a href="https://caniuse.com/css-variables"&gt;browser
                support&lt;/a&gt; for a while now. Colours and margin/padding lengths are ideal usecases for
                them.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h3 id="7-yes-namespaces"&gt;7. Yes namespaces&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I've found very useful to overload class names with namespaces, based on page or resource
                names. For example, if form buttons are different than bare buttons, then those classes will be
                &lt;code&gt;form-btn-submit&lt;/code&gt;. Another recurring example is special styling for the landing
                page, which I'd namespace as &lt;code&gt;landing-*&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h3 id="8-yes-rule-local-responsive-media-queries"&gt;8. Yes rule-local responsive media
                queries&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The question is whether to place all rules for a specific breakpoints all together, or rules
                for the same classes together across different breakpoints. I vote for the second option, so that when
                one wants to read or change the rules for e.g. &lt;code&gt;nav&lt;/code&gt;, they see all rules for all
                breakpoints together, rather than jumping to different places of the file for the other breakpoints.
                Example:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div style="background: #fdf6e3;"&gt;&lt;pre style=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #268bd2;"&gt;projects-grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt; {&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #859900;"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #859900;"&gt;grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #859900;"&gt;grid-template-columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;:
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;fr
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;fr
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;fr;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #859900;"&gt;media&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #268bd2;"&gt;max-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #268bd2;"&gt;490px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt; {&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt; .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #268bd2;"&gt;projects-grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt; {&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #859900;"&gt;grid-template-columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;:
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;fr
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;fr;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt; }&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #859900;"&gt;media&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #268bd2;"&gt;max-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #268bd2;"&gt;340px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt; {&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt; .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #268bd2;"&gt;projects-grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt; {&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #859900;"&gt;grid-template-columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;:
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;fr;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt; }&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;h2 id="limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The limitations of this system lie mostly on compatibility. &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Firstly, preprocessors would automagically fill the blanks with vendor-prefixed properties and
                polyfills. Without those, some problems might arise.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Secondly, IE11 does not support CSS variables, which we say yes to.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="workflow"&gt;Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Most of the times I'm designing a new webpage with no existing design, I have found that
                capturing my vague ideas into a concrete design in a vector editor is the best way to start. After that,
                I focus on writing the HTML. The reason for not writing the HTML and the CSS in parallel lies mostly in
                the unknown intricacies of the layout that will be followed. If a CSS grid is needed, for example, this
                is the step to decide that.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Final stage is actually writing the CSS code. I try to group the rules together based on where
                they are used. Generic selectors like &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt; go
                first, then &lt;code&gt;form&lt;/code&gt; and their conceptual children such as
                &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt;, and then namespaces of other resources and pages.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;One can find an actual example of all the ideas in action on the &lt;a
                href="https://git.sr.ht/~sirodoht/mataroa/tree/master/main/static/style.css"&gt;sr.ht repo&lt;/a&gt; of
                the &lt;a href="https://mataroa.blog/"&gt;mataroa.blog&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
                &lt;hr&gt;
                &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Stephanie Stimac has a interesting example on &lt;a
                href="https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/06/browser-fonts/"&gt;font rendering
                incosistencies&lt;/a&gt;. Also, the &lt;a
                href="https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/blob/master/normalize.css"&gt;source code
                comments&lt;/a&gt; for normalize.css are enlightening.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref"
                href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Matthew Butterick provides another case, a very interesting &lt;a
                href="https://practicaltypography.com/why-google-fonts-arent-really-open-source.html"&gt;critique&lt;/a&gt;
                on Google Fonts, in regards to them not being open-source.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref"
                href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ol&gt;

            <title>On school improvement</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/on-school-improvement/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Few would disagree that the educational system of the —so-called— Western world &lt;a
                href="/blog/whats-wrong-with-school/"&gt;could be improved&lt;/a&gt;. Eight partially concrete concepts
                on a potential improvement follow.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Less information. Slash the amount of information included in the courses. Aim to keep the
                essence, the fundamentals, the knowledge that a student is expected to either remember 10 years later or
                to have been &lt;a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/know.html"&gt;influenced by it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;More humanities and art. There are many forms of art, and even the simplest change of
                dedicating a couple of hours per week on those would be beneficial (yet admittedly crude).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;More bodily knowledge. The importance of physical activity both for physical health but also
                for psychological health cannot be overstated. More classes of exercising and sports is an easy first
                step.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Teacher quality assessment by students. Students are the essence and purpose of the whole
                operation. How could we not deeply value their impressions?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Teacher freedom. Teaching and learning are creative processes in their very core. If a teacher
                is micromanaged by laws on how to teach, then learning will probably not happen; only a knowledge
                auditory event will.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;De-professionalise teaching. Accomplished educationalists &lt;a
                href="https://www.ted.com/talks/sir_ken_robinson_how_to_escape_education_s_death_valley/transcript"&gt;talk
                about&lt;/a&gt; this idea for quite some time. If only, it's worth a serious attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;School as a more integrated part of society. Let's incorporate school as part of every society
                member's life. Non-parent professionals can teach. Others can learn. Is there an argument for not being
                inclusive?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Student freedom and abolishment of mandated studying. Every time a student is graded with a
                failure mark in an exam it is proof that people cannot force people to learn. Let's entrust students
                with the responsibility to decide what to learn, when, where, and how.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ol&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Homage to Chocolate</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/homage-to-chocolate/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Chocolate is a true heavenly wonder of this world.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Every time I see some chocolate, I feel an amazement just by looking, smelling and feeling such
                a substance. Its texture, rough yet soft. Its colour, original and satisfying. Its smell, deep and
                luscious.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The structure of a chocolate is one of its defining characteristics. Rigid and firm but if one
                opts for partitioning, they could easily snap it. When looking at the edges of what used to be a
                connection, a view into the chocolate’s soul surfaces. A view that is authentic, beautiful, perfect in
                its imperfectness of the uneven crack.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the same way it breaks by hand, it breaks by mouth. Teeth slowly crush the actualised
                divinity and with each crack the sublime material is divided in half. In this very process, inimitable
                sensations develop. Transcendental flavours fly all around one’s mouth, an explosion of saliva takes
                place and a hurricane of frenzy cacao intervenes — one nobody wants to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Yet only a handful of seconds later it does. This is one of those moments — how could we ever
                not appreciate the fact that we have as much of this celestial elixir we want. The limit is in our
                digestive apparatus, not in the abundance of the world. I now understand why people say we should be
                more thankful. It’s due to chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;One would think that even the thought of chocolate ending as a resource would upset me. Yet, I
                feel peace. Even if chocolate completely disappears from the world, I would be serenely jubilant that we
                had the opportunity to experience it.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, we still have loads of chocolate and every day I can buy a well sized portion for
                one unit of currency. Isn’t that even more amazing?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Book: Less is More by Jason Hickel</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/book-less-is-more-by-jason-hickel/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jasonhickel.org/less-is-more"&gt;Less is More: How Degrowth
                Will Save the World&lt;/a&gt;. A new book by Jason Hickel.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;“We are not the defenders of the river. We are the river.”&lt;br&gt;
                – Fisherman, Magdalena River, Colombia&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Core idea of capitalism is: one not only has to always profit but also do it in an accelerating
                way. When one does not grow enough, it's an economic crisis. The movement of degrowth raises the
                arguments against this &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_(sociology)"&gt;social
                imaginary&lt;/a&gt;. Always growing is irrational, with no basis, but more importantly it is fatally
                dangerous. Earth is a balanced system; humanity is one of the cogs and by massively exploiting the
                Earth's resources the balance is no more and the system collapses.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Degrowth is about scaling down world production, as it's the only way to prevent the
                aforementioned environmental collapse. There are several pathways:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;End planned obsolescence. The lightbulb's life is the most famous example.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Advertising. Manipulating people to make irrational purchases does increase the GDP yet it
                doesn't improve our well-being.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Usership. Not every house needs a lawn mower every day.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;End food waste. 30%-50% of all the food that's being produced is wasted.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Scale down eco-destructive industries. E.g. fossil fuel and beef.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ol&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, these pathways require massive economic and social restructuring. Countless
                problems, expected and unexpected, will arise. The author provides answers and solutions to many, yet,
                of course it could never be enough. Alas, it seems it's the only way to mitigate the sixth
                extinction.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Looking back millions of years into the Earth system’s history there have been five mass
                extinction events. It looks like the &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction"&gt;sixth&lt;/a&gt; one has began.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;“Recent figures show that around 85% of global fish stocks are now depleted or facing collapse.
                Haddock have fallen to 1% of their former volume; halibut, those magnificent giants of the sea, to
                one-fifth of 1%. Fish catches are beginning to decline around the world, for the first time in recorded
                history. In the Asia-Pacific, fishery yields are on track to hit zero by 2048. &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Most of this is due to aggressive overfishing: just as with agriculture, corporations have
                turned fishing into an act of warfare, using industrial megatrawlers to scrape the seafloor in their
                hunt for increasingly scarce fish, hauling up hundreds of species in order to catch the few that have
                ‘market value’, turning coral gardens and colourful ecosystems into lifeless plains in the process.
                Whole ocean landscapes have been decimated in the scramble for profit.” &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;– Excerpt from “Less is More” by Jason Hickel, Chapter: &lt;em&gt;Welcome to the
                Anthropocene&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The book begins with a very succinct state of affairs on the Earth system. Hopelessness
                overtakes one's mind as the amount of suffering and death humanity has caused during the last 500 years
                is immeasurable. In exchange for what? Inequality in survival potential—caused by the few at the top.
                But, Jason's &lt;a href="https://www.jasonhickel.org/the-divide"&gt;other book&lt;/a&gt; is a much more
                complete case for this argument.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;When a constituent of a system does not play its role then the system’s collapse is inevitable.
                This is what happened a few thousand years ago, during the &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austronesian_peoples#Austronesian_expansion"&gt;Austronesian
                expansion&lt;/a&gt;, when humans left mainland Asia and settled in the islands of south-east Pacific
                Ocean. Being accustomed to the huge ecosystem of mainland Asia, they didn’t consider that those small
                islands have a much more delicate life balance. Their rate of tree cutting and animal hunting were
                unsustainable, which lead to whole islands collapsing and being abandoned. However, the settlers learned
                from their mistakes. They understood how the ecosystem worked and did, subsequently, achieve a balance
                that allowed all organisms of the ecosystem to live.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is the challenge we are facing, only this time on a planet level rather than on a small
                island. Odds are against us. It will require global collaboration in an unprecedented level. It's one of
                the greatest collective challenges of all time. If one is looking for something to work on, this is a
                considerably attractive choice.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The author says this is a book about hope. It’s difficult to apprehend that, especially in the
                beginning of the book. As it progresses, potential solutions are offered but their application and
                success do not seem likely. &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the end, after having the whole picture together, one can finally understand. True optimism
                is not blind optimism. And true hope is not one without knowing the bleakness of reality. One has to
                know; and still venture into this high-stakes undertaking—not because they fear death, but because they
                are excited about life. &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is why this book is about hope.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>What’s wrong with school?</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/whats-wrong-with-school/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;There is constant chatter on the embarrassing quality of schools across the vast
                majority of our planet’s countries. This is a chatter-organising attempt in fourteen structured—yet not
                in order of priority—points of what and why.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In an attempt to justify disagreements, this list is based mostly on my personal experience
                with the few schools I went to, in the one—Western, first world—country I went to. Surely, different
                schools do exist with different practices, yet I do imply that what follows is very common.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Schools are awfully rubbish due to:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Lack of student autonomy. Every part and limit of the student’s behaviour is defined a priori.
                Their exact location during school hours is predetermined. Periods of sitting and standing are decided
                almost by law. Predefined hours of being inside and outside. Predefined and forced single viewpoint:
                written in the approved book, expressed from the teacher, established by the legislator. Even further:
                students' thoughts are mandated to follow and adopt their teacher's thoughts at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Failure in diversity management. Not everyone has the same talents, skills, background,
                desires. Yet, not only is everything already defined, but it's also identical for all. Even if people’s
                characteristics coincide, the timing may not. Still, in the eyes of the educational system, same age
                means same person.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Lack of teacher autonomy. Defining teaching material by the state might had been a good idea in
                the past, but now, all knowledge is available to everyone—for free—and that changes everything. The role
                of the teacher is—and has probably always been—nothing more than the role of a repeater. It doesn't have
                to be this way, and a usually small creative set of teachers demonstrate and prove this daily. Forging
                teacher homogeneity to shield students from bad teachers has resulted in the total restriction of
                teachers. Inescapably, this has lead to total lack of creativity and teaching becoming a lifeless
                transfer of information, as opposed to the achievement of quenching one's thirst for knowledge. It is
                undeniable: one cannot have the power for creation without also having the freedom for
                destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Lack of teacher quality assessment. Measuring is fundamental to improving. Absence of
                improvement inevitably leads to absence of skill.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Lack of regard for the teacher's responsibility towards society. The importance of the work of
                the teacher is monumentally undervalued. High quality teachers are intrinsically connected to more
                educated society members. Extremely important propositions cascade from this. For instance, higher
                quality representative democracy due to better educated voters.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Blatant ageism. Adult teachers teaching young kids, ad infinitum. Even kids teaching kids was
                too bizarre to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Pointless curricula size. The amount of knowledge “taught” to students in primary and secondary
                education is preposterous. Both in terms of a twelve-year educational system and in terms of continuous
                learning for six or seven hours per day everyday. The glaring evidence of such unsustainability cannot
                be overstated.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Pointless curricula content. The cybernetic network humanity is part of makes every piece of
                information available in a few seconds time. There is no point in learning information; there is point
                in learning fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Irrelevant methods of teaching. Lifeless lectures, indifferent presentations, eternal
                monologues, stressful exams, digitally-assisted learning, interactive learning; mostly rubbish. True
                learning happens alone; and usually with boring tools.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Total disregard for art. Virtually everything is revolving around STEM. Art, in any form, is
                completely disfavoured by everyone: teachers, students, parents, lawmakers. Art's timeless honesty
                perpetuates the human era since its inception, yet it was deemed unworthy for the intellectual
                foundation of new humans.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Partial disregard for the humanities. Along with its aforementioned conceptual subclass, human
                disciples have fallen out of favour, as being ineffective in building wealth—the core value of our &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_(sociology)"&gt;imaginary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Total disregard for physical knowledge. Disturbingly small amount of school-approved time on
                exercising, sports, or any other bodily activity.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Existence of homework. Even the most hard working professions allow for leisure time at
                home.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Limited societal framework. Students learning from teachers in a restricted facility for an
                extraneously-defined set of hours per day. School has been shaped as a silo, when it could have been
                shaped as an essential integrated part of everybody's—even non-parent non-student adults'—societal
                life.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ol&gt;</description>

            <title>Housing as UBI</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/housing-as-ubi/</link>
            <description>&lt;h2 id="unthinkability"&gt;Unthinkability&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It's unthinkable that in 2020 not everyone lives in a home. Home, as in the most simple,
                barebones place that one can sleep and get shelter from the rain and cold.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It's even more unthinkable that in the world's richest cities and countries, this statement is
                still true.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;And finally, it is unthinkable in terms of Paul Graham's &lt;a
                href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html#self"&gt;future present&lt;/a&gt;, that artists,
                makers, innovators, and inventors are pushed out of cities because &lt;em&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://wintermute.org/brendan/?e=168"&gt;the rent is too damn high&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="in-order-of-importance"&gt;In order of importance&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;One could condemn the above argument inasmuch as housing is more difficult than anything else
                we have achieved in 2020. Yet the constantly rising number of empty homes, &lt;a
                href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/11/empty-homes-england-rises-property"&gt;in
                London&lt;/a&gt; for example, and other major urban centres, proves that this is not a case of
                feasibility, but rather of profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Home and &lt;a
                href="https://www.nrdc.org/resources/wasted-how-america-losing-40-percent-its-food-farm-fork-landfill"&gt;food
                waste&lt;/a&gt; are both issues of economic equality, rather than resource scarcity. Their resolution
                will mean substantial life quality boost on a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Housing in particular seems to be the immediate next step for life quality. For lower social
                strata, rent is the single largest expense that cannot be reduced unless one devolves into homelessness.
                &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income"&gt;UBI&lt;/a&gt; is what has been increasingly
                brought up as the solution for the problems automation creates in the future of work, yet if we could
                subtract rent from the monthly budget of low income workers, we might not even need UBI.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="antithesis"&gt;Antithesis&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Ultra cheap housing shares some of the problems of UBI. To name one: if people aren't mandated
                to work to survive, why would they?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income_pilots"&gt;not enough
                research&lt;/a&gt; on the matter, but it feels obvious that if housing was cheap (or UBI guaranteed)
                nobody would work as a low-paid unskilled worker ever again. They would either live a workless life or
                acquire knowledge to assume a more pivotal role for the professional part of their life.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In that case, would Amazon deliverers be replaced by drones? Would robots serve at
                McDonalds?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="inevitability"&gt;Inevitability&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;David Fairhurst, chief people officer at McDonald’s Europe in 2014, &lt;a
                href="https://www.hospitalityandcateringnews.com/2014/04/retaining-women-is-key-as-mcdonalds-warns-of-workforce-cliff/"&gt;came
                up&lt;/a&gt; with an unforeseen issue. He claims that Europe and the US will soon experience the
                &lt;em&gt;workforce cliff&lt;/em&gt;. We have too many colossal enterprises, getting much bigger, and
                not enough people to work on them.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;David believes this problem will start materializing during the current decade. If that does
                happen, enterprises will supposedly not only have to turn to automation for help but also strive for its
                rapid advancement. If the degree of automation required for that obstacle to be surpassed is achieved, a
                new level of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-scarcity_economy"&gt;post-scarcity&lt;/a&gt;
                will surface. &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It's tempting to make the prediction that if workforce cliff happens, handling post-scarcity
                while maintaining the current production growth of the global economy will be the defining
                characteristic of the 21st century. Until one starts thinking about the inevitability of the
                environmental collapse unless we &lt;a

                Or the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_vests_movement"&gt;increasing economic
                inequality&lt;/a&gt;. Or would it be &lt;a

                governance&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Whatever the case; what an era to live in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Feasible setup for passwords and backups</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/feasible-setup-for-passwords-and-backups/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;People on the internet say it's a good idea to backup your data. Obviously, normal
                people ignore them. No one likes complicated processes with unclear long-term benefits&lt;sup
                id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;However, there is a neat way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="borg-for-backups"&gt;borg for backups&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It is &lt;a href="https://rsync.net/products/attic.html"&gt;well known&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a
                href="https://www.borgbackup.org/"&gt;borg&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a
                href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/holy-grail-backups/"&gt;Holy Grail of backups&lt;/a&gt;. Along with
                &lt;a href="https://www.rsync.net/"&gt;rsync.net&lt;/a&gt; it’s a battle-tested combination that has
                worked great for many.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;However, there is a (not so much anymore) new player in town, &lt;a
                href="https://restic.net/"&gt;restic&lt;/a&gt;. Does everything better except one important thing.
                Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;restic is one binary in contrast to borg (Go vs Python/C)&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;restic does not need a server-side component&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;restic can work with multiple protocols vs borg's SSH&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;restic supports multiple machines backing up to the same repository&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;restic supports multiple unlock keys&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;borg has better performance? — &lt;a href="https://stickleback.dk/borg-or-restic/"&gt;claimed
                here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;borg is a more mature project&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;borg supports multiple compression algorithms while restic doesn’t support compression (&lt;a
                href="https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/21"&gt;yet?&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The last one is quite important if one is paying for the extra space. But, your data might
                already be compressed, in which case, borg’s compression won't mean much to you.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="pass-for-passwords"&gt;pass for passwords&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It's sad that in 2020 every website implements authentication and authorization in their own
                nonideal and potentially insecure way. And it still eludes me why &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn"&gt;WebAuthn&lt;/a&gt; wasn't invented and implemented in
                2000. In any case, we still need to manually&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref"
                href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; create, save, input, change passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/"&gt;pass&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;em&gt;standard unix
                password manager&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a very thin porcelain over GPG, which acts as a password manager. The
                command line interface, along with the bash completion is lovable. The way it works is, it creates a
                specific GPG key and then encrypts each password as a file, inside a directory,
                &lt;code&gt;~/.password-store&lt;/code&gt;. The passphrase of that GPG key is one’s master password.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;There is also a sweet variety of &lt;a
                href="https://www.passwordstore.org/#extensions"&gt;extensions and clients&lt;/a&gt; on top of
                it.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="frank-for-2fa"&gt;frank for 2FA&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It was a happy simple life in the past, a password manager would solve all your problems. Now
                we need to solve 2FA/MFA too. The most famous solution, Google Authenticator, has a couple of problems.
                Namely, it’s Google’s, so one day it might not even be in the app store. To make matters worse, it
                doesn’t allow exporting. Once you import the secret, it’s locked in, forevermore. Finally, it isn’t
                synced to your Google account, so if one loses their phone, they are done for.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Google: Don't lose your phone!&lt;br&gt;
                Normal person: Oh noes! I thought there would be no consequences :(&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Some password managers like 1Password offer cloud 2FA solutions, but we would have to trust
                them to enjoy that. I couldn’t find any solid standalone CLI solutions, so I made &lt;a
                href="https://github.com/sirodoht/frank"&gt;a thing&lt;/a&gt; of my own. &lt;a
                href="https://imgur.com/gallery/6eleD"&gt;Bad idea&lt;/a&gt;—I know! But I used a pretty &lt;a
                href="https://github.com/pquerna/otp"&gt;good OTP library&lt;/a&gt; (I think) and just wrote the
                terminal input part.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Combining with gopass + sed we get this magnificent, ^R-able, one-liner for retrieving our AWS
                MFA key:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div style="background: #fdf6e3;"&gt;&lt;pre style=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ frank &lt;span
                style="color: #859900;"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;gopass aws.amazon.com &lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; sed -n &lt;span style="color:
                #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;#39;2p&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #859900;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; pbcopy
                &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The sed part exists because the MFA secret is in the second line of the gopass output. &lt;a
                href="https://ss64.com/osx/pbcopy.html"&gt;pbcopy&lt;/a&gt; auto-copies it.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As you might have guessed by now, there are several limitations in this way of managing one's
                cybernetic life. For starters, borg is complicated even for programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Programmer: Is this the passphrase? But then which one is the secret key? Do I have to
                remember both my secret key and my passphrase? That's mental.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;gopass&lt;/code&gt; is not UX friendly unless you are weird; and
                &lt;code&gt;frank&lt;/code&gt; is the same. Not to mention that nothing works from your own phone as
                nothing is synced, which is a major deal-breaker for many.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Weird person: gopass is nice.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Yet, the article's title is unambiguous: a &lt;em&gt;feasible&lt;/em&gt; option.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
                &lt;hr&gt;
                &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Incidentally, that's also the reason people don't like taxes.&amp;#160;&lt;a
                class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the
                text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Not that we have, ourselves, to XOR &lt;code&gt;OrpheanBeholderScryDoubt&lt;/code&gt; 64 times.
                But still, a chore done more than 887 times according to &lt;code&gt;gopass ls|wc
                -l&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2
                in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ol&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;</description>

            <title>Mataroa webring integration</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/mataroa-webring-integration/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Extremely excited to announce that &lt;a
                href="https://mataroa.blog"&gt;mataroa.blog&lt;/a&gt; now has a &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring"&gt;webring&lt;/a&gt; integration!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;One can add two URLs: "next" and "previous", and become part of the arcane technique of
                decentralised content discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="start-your-ring"&gt;Start your ring&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE May 2021: This tool no longer works due to the new referrer policies by
                &lt;a
                href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/07/referrer-policy-new-chrome-default"&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;
                and &lt;a
                href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/03/22/firefox-87-trims-http-referrers-by-default-to-protect-user-privacy/"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://mxb.dev/"&gt;Max Böck&lt;/a&gt; made a nice &lt;a
                href="https://mxb.dev/blog/webring-kit/"&gt;Webring Kit&lt;/a&gt; that enables dynamic next/previous
                webring links, so that one does not have to manually edit those on their website. Adds a bit of
                centralisation but makes it much easier to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The kit uses the &lt;a href="https://www.11ty.dev/"&gt;Eleventy&lt;/a&gt; static site generator
                and is configured to deploy on Netlify. Get started &lt;a
                href="https://github.com/maxboeck/webring"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="revival"&gt;Revival&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The need for webrings stemmed during the 90s when there was no Google and search engines were
                inefficient in helping people discover web content.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The need re-arises in 2020, when search engines are influenced by SEO techniques and content
                platforms have become silos. These days, an indie web revival would be incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A webring has a specific theme, and the links that comprise it are curated. Manually curating a
                webring's content means that it has been agreed that the website's content is relevant to the webring's
                theme. The modern web approach would be to add a neural network to figure out the website's theme, but
                that would be totally not fly!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="see-also"&gt;See also&lt;/h2&gt;

            <title>Mercury’s Odyssey by The Olympians</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/mercurys-odyssey-by-the-olympians/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mercury’s Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; is an instrumental song by &lt;a
                href="https://theolympians.bandcamp.com/"&gt;The Olympians&lt;/a&gt;. The following commentary is an
                attempt to make a depiction of its brilliance in English words.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Recommended way of enjoyment: listen to the music while maintaining a connection to the
                assigned second of each commentary bit.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;"
                src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3950293300/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=2162363188/transparent=true/"
                seamless&gt;&amp;lt;a href="http://theolympians.bandcamp.com/album/the-olympians"&amp;gt;The Olympians
                by The Olympians&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;0:00&lt;br&gt;
                Starting with a piano and drums combinational dribble while we rapidly ascend into—&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;0:02&lt;br&gt;
                A slightly stripped-down quadruple symphony of equal power. The main actors: piano, drums, bass,
                and—&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;0:21&lt;br&gt;
                Welcome, wind instrument. Our previous three-body fellowship continues as if nothing has happened and
                the whole quartet gives off a feeling of stableness.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;0:40&lt;br&gt;
                Slight sorrow, in four identical stages, gets the upper hand.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;1:01&lt;br&gt;
                Explosion preparation and…&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;1:07&lt;br&gt;
                What a blast. The windy protagonist explodes full of bliss and energy. Everything spins around
                supporting the brass majesty whilst the piano is stealing the performance only by a small bit—an omen of
                things to come.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;1:26&lt;br&gt;
                Returning into stableness. Heed for the bass's contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;1:45&lt;br&gt;
                With the familiar four-part descent into sadness.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;2:06&lt;br&gt;
                Explosion preparation, but this time—&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;2:11&lt;br&gt;
                Anticlimactic. Lack of tension release.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;2:18&lt;br&gt;
                A wobble; latent climax incoming.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;2:21&lt;br&gt;
                Coolness. As if everything is where it’s supposed to be. Universal balance while the keybordial
                protagonist realises a creative race with no competition.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;2:40&lt;br&gt;
                Brass cry. Fully supported, the piano explores new worlds, unbeknownst to us. Full-blown party around
                fresh melodies.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;2:45&lt;br&gt;
                Don’t be distracted by the brass voices because you might miss the piano’s sustained majesty.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;2:50&lt;br&gt;
                Shout on the clock.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;2:55&lt;br&gt;
                Final shout just before—&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;2:58&lt;br&gt;
                Explosion. Proper this time, as the pianistic transcendentality continues uninterrupted. Pure,
                infectious celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;3:17&lt;br&gt;
                Back to stableness, this time the final one…&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;3:22&lt;br&gt;
                Fading out fast…&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;3:30&lt;br&gt;
                …and death!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Building mataroa.blog</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/building-mataroa-blog/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;This article is about building &lt;a
                href="https://mataroa.blog/"&gt;mataroa.blog&lt;/a&gt;, a minimal blogging platform with export as a
                first-class feature, built with Python and Django.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to git, I started the &lt;a href="https://git.sr.ht/~sirodoht/mataroa/"&gt;mataroa
                repo&lt;/a&gt; on May 27th, 2020, 20:37 UTC, just a few hours after my friend &lt;a
                href="https://www.stavros.io/"&gt;Stavros&lt;/a&gt; sent me the link of &lt;a
                href="https://bearblog.dev/"&gt;Bear Blog&lt;/a&gt;. We thought it was genius —Bear Blog— and I decided
                to make something similar, mainly because I would enjoy building it. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a
                class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="rss"&gt;RSS&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;After submitting to HN, the first comment I got was that the lack of RSS was a dealbreaker.
                Heartbreak. Quickly rushed to implement it. It took 47 minutes for the implementation, testing, and UI
                polishing.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The reason for this speed lies in Django having an excellent built-in
                "syndication-feed-generating framework". It's very simple to acquire basic functionality:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div style="background: #fdf6e3;"&gt;&lt;pre style=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;# main/feeds.py&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #cb4b16;"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #268bd2;"&gt;django.contrib.syndication.views&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #cb4b16;"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;Feed&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #cb4b16;"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #268bd2;"&gt;django.http&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #cb4b16;"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;Http404&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span style="color: #cb4b16;"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #268bd2;"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #cb4b16;"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;


                &lt;span style="color: #859900;"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #268bd2;"&gt;RSSBlogFeed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;(Feed):&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;quot;Blog&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;quot;Cool blog resides
                here&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span style="color: #859900;"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #268bd2;"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #268bd2;"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #859900;"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;objects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;filter()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;order_by(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;quot;-created_at&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span style="color: #859900;"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #268bd2;"&gt;item_title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #268bd2;"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;item):&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #859900;"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span style="color: #859900;"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #268bd2;"&gt;item_description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #268bd2;"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;item):&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #859900;"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;div style="background: #fdf6e3;"&gt;&lt;pre style=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;# main/urls.py&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;urlpatterns&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;path(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;quot;rss/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;feeds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;RSSBlogFeed(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;&amp;quot;rss_feed&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;But, that didn't work for mataroa as it returns all (across all blogs) posts.
                We wanted to get only those that were from the subdomain requested.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;After looking into the &lt;a
                href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/3a6fa1d962ad9bd5678290bc22dd35bff13eb1f5/django/contrib/syndication/views.py#L29"&gt;extremely
                readable&lt;/a&gt; Django source code of the &lt;code&gt;Feed&lt;/code&gt; class, the following addition
                was made in the &lt;code&gt;RSSBlogFeed&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div style="background: #fdf6e3;"&gt;&lt;pre style=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #859900;"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #268bd2;"&gt;__call__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #268bd2;"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;request,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;args,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;kwargs):&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;# check that user requests a subdomain (non-bare domain)
                site&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #859900;"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #859900;"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #268bd2;"&gt;hasattr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:

                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:

                &lt;span style="color: #268bd2;"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;subdomain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span
                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;subdomain&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #859900;"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #268bd2;"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;(RSSBlogFeed,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span
                style="color: #268bd2;"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #268bd2;"&gt;__call__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;(request,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span
                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;args,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span
                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;kwargs)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;We want the request object, because &lt;code&gt;subdomain&lt;/code&gt; resides in there. Based
                on that, we have the user (which means we have the blog title too) and finally we can define the
                queryset:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div style="background: #fdf6e3;"&gt;&lt;pre style=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #859900;"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #268bd2;"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #268bd2;"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #859900;"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:

                style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span style="color: #859900;"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #268bd2;"&gt;__str__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #268bd2;"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #859900;"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #268bd2;"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;2 models, 46 lines.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The first idea towards simplicity here was that there's no need for Blog to be a separate
                model. It was a given that the User model would be overriden, and having multiple blogs under one user
                would be out of scope. Thus, why not just add &lt;code&gt;blog_title&lt;/code&gt; in the User
                model.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Another matter of thought was how to handle &lt;code&gt;get_absolute_url&lt;/code&gt;.
                Thankfully, we have all parts needed there. We just need to assemble them by using this f-string — of
                which versions come up numerous times across the app.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div style="background: #fdf6e3;"&gt;&lt;pre style=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;f&amp;quot;//{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #268bd2;"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;owner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;}.{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;settings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;CANONICAL_HOST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;}{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;h2 id="subdomain-middleware"&gt;Subdomain middleware&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This part is the core of how we handle subdomains using the same app.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div style="background: #fdf6e3;"&gt;&lt;pre style=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span

                &lt;p&gt;A simple function-based Django middleware that checks the HTTP &lt;code&gt;Host&lt;/code&gt;
                header. If there are 3 dots, it means we have something like
                &lt;code&gt;subdomain.mataroa.blog&lt;/code&gt;. If so, we stick it in
                &lt;code&gt;request.subdomain&lt;/code&gt; and have it there for the rest of the trip!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;For example, (and most important case) when &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; is requested, we want to
                know whether we should serve the landing or a blog:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div style="background: #fdf6e3;"&gt;&lt;pre style=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;# main/views.py&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;# check if request has subdomain attr&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;# check if this subdomain is a blog that exists&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;For the premium plan interest form, we sent an email to the admin letting them know of the
                submission. A conscious decision to avoid a new model for subscribers was made here.&lt;/p&gt;

                we&amp;#39;ll be in touch :)&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span style="color: #859900;"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:

                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;form):&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:

                &lt;h2 id="disallowed-usernames"&gt;Disallowed usernames&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Since usernames are subdomains, some of them had to be disallowed. I found a rather extensive
                list online and trimmed it down to 50. Some of the most notable are &lt;code&gt;api&lt;/code&gt;,
                &lt;code&gt;admin&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cdn&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;,
                &lt;code&gt;random&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The implementation includes &lt;code&gt;form.add_error&lt;/code&gt;, which I don't recall ever
                using in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div style="background: #fdf6e3;"&gt;&lt;pre style=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span

                &lt;h2 id="export-to-zola"&gt;Export to Zola&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The feature that makes mataroa an un-platform is that it helps you get off it. It minimizes
                vendor lock-in by enabling the blog owner, with a single click, to be able to setup a static website
                with all their posts.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Exporting to &lt;a href="https://www.getzola.org/"&gt;Zola&lt;/a&gt; was the first feature I
                wrote because I was too afraid of its implementation. Turns out it was easier than expected. The full
                view method is around 40 lines.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div style="background: #fdf6e3;"&gt;&lt;pre style=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;# main/views.py&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;# get all posts and add them into export_posts encoded&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;posts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:

                &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;zola_&lt;/code&gt; prefixed variables are strings (not list of strings) of

                title&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #2aa198;"&gt;f&amp;quot;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;}
                blog&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;h2 id="permissions"&gt;Permissions&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;For permission checking I considered the &lt;a
                href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/auth/default/#permissions-and-authorization"&gt;native
                Django solution&lt;/a&gt; but it was an overkill. Except for &lt;code&gt;LoginRequiredMixin&lt;/code&gt;
                and &lt;code&gt;user.is_authenticated&lt;/code&gt; the following lines are the core of every permission
                check:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div style="background: #fdf6e3;"&gt;&lt;pre style=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #859900;"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;subdomain:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #859900;"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;PermissionDenied()&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Interesting bit is the preference of raising a &lt;code&gt;PermissionDenied&lt;/code&gt;
                exception to the return of &lt;code&gt;HttpResponseForbidden&lt;/code&gt;. The latter resulted in an
                empty page while the former returned a default text of black letters &lt;code&gt;403
                Forbidden&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="post-creation"&gt;Post creation&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;On the post creation page we hide the slug field. It declutters the form a bit and lets you
                focus more on the actual writing than to find the best SEO-wise slug.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Thus, we generate the slug using yet another brilliant battery of Django:
                &lt;code&gt;django.utils.text.slugify&lt;/code&gt;. Also, a check in case another identical slug (in the
                same blog) exists. This solution might be unideal but the number of infinite loops I have created in
                past projects solving this with &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; (countless) in contrast to the times one
                uuid suffix was not enough (zero) is a good reason.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We also inject the post owner, preventing any hijacking of users creating posts in others'
                blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div style="background: #fdf6e3;"&gt;&lt;pre style=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;# main/views.py&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #859900;"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #268bd2;"&gt;form_valid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #268bd2;"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;form):&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;# commit=False to decrease SQL writes by one&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #268bd2;"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span
                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;save(commit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;# slugification&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #268bd2;"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:

                &lt;p&gt;It was a really enjoyable project as a whole and the above bits the most amusing to figure out.
                Undoubtedly, their elegance can be futher improved and I am looking forward to learning how.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As the project grows the above bits will change. The commit hash the above snippets of code are
                taken from is &lt;code&gt;48af918dd84a9a579db6dcc95461669e4cbf8d08&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;You can find the most recent version of the mataroa source code at &lt;a
                href="https://sr.ht/~sirodoht/mataroa/"&gt;sr.ht/~sirodoht/mataroa/&lt;/a&gt;. Or browse the tree of the
                above commit hash &lt;a

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Everybody knows that &lt;a href="https://github.com/dokku/dokku"&gt;dokku&lt;/a&gt; is
                the best thing ever when it comes to deploying web applications. Unfortunately, though, the best thing's
                Let's Encrypt plugin &lt;a
                href="https://github.com/dokku/dokku-letsencrypt"&gt;dokku-letsencrypt&lt;/a&gt; does not support
                wildcard certificates.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is how to succeed when faced with such challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="dokku-certs-inner-workings"&gt;dokku certs inner workings&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Dokku stores everything around the deployment of an app in a aptly named directory inside
                &lt;code&gt;/home/dokku&lt;/code&gt;. It also stores the certificates there, which are referenced from
                the app's nginx.conf.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;An app's nginx.conf is customizable via the sigil template dokku uses.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Assuming we get a wildcard certificate, one way to install it would be to copy the cert files
                there and let the templated nginx config find it. This course of action would also require changing the
                &lt;code&gt;DOKKU_PROXY_PORT_MAP&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DOKKU_PROXY_SSL_PORT&lt;/code&gt; app
                environment variables to include the 443 port mapping so that the template understands that certificates
                exist and accepts requests at 443.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But there is a better way, by using the &lt;code&gt;dokku certs&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="getting-the-wildcard-cert"&gt;Getting the wildcard cert&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;First we need to get our wildcard cert manually. &lt;a
                href="https://certbot.eff.org/"&gt;certbot&lt;/a&gt; supports wildcard certficates with this
                command:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges=dns
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;When asked for the domain, enter both the bare root domain and the wildcard one. I.e.
                &lt;code&gt;example.com, *.example.com&lt;/code&gt;. Dokku's wish is to have one cert/key pair per app
                and we must respect it.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The command asks for a DNS challenge (it's the only option on wildcard domains), a TXT record
                on a subdomain.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;After following all the steps methodically, it generates the cert and the private key at:
                &lt;code&gt;/etc/letsencrypt/live/&amp;lt;you-domain&amp;gt;/fullchain.pem&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="installing-the-cert-into-dokku"&gt;Installing the cert into dokku&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku~v0.20.4/configuration/ssl/#certificate-setting"&gt;Dokku
                states&lt;/a&gt; it is intelligent enough to understand which is which even when they are not named
                &lt;code&gt;server.key&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;server.crt&lt;/code&gt;. Yet I still renamed them —
                not that I don't trust software. Then tar'ed them as per dokku's desire with:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div style="background: #fdf6e3;"&gt;&lt;pre style=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;tar cvf certs.tar
                server.key server.crt
                &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Finally, the actual installation process, which was much less complicated than
                expected:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div style="background: #fdf6e3;"&gt;&lt;pre style=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;dokku certs:add
                mataroa &amp;lt; certs.tar
                &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;And that's it. &lt;a href="https://mataroa.blog/"&gt;mataroa.blog&lt;/a&gt; was wildcardly
                certificated.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="renewal"&gt;Renewal&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Let's Encrypt certificates are valid for 3 months, at which point, because it's a
                &lt;code&gt;--manual&lt;/code&gt; certbot command, you need to do the same operation from the top

            <title>Welcome to Mataroa!</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/welcome-to-mataroa/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;I am really happy to announce this new project!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Created out of authentic admiration of Herman's genius idea of &lt;a
                href="https://bearblog.dev/"&gt;Bear Blog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a
                href="//mataroa.blog"&gt;Mataroa.blog&lt;/a&gt; is like Bear Blog but also a bit different. Namely, it
                has built-in first-class support to export your blog, and it also supports image hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The core philosophy, however, remains the same: dead simple blogging.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Why would one create another service with minimal differences? Bear Blog is great indeed and by
                having another option the personal blogging ecosystem is enhanced. The space of no-tracking no-ads
                websites gets bigger. Faster, lighter web wins. At the end of the day, I really enjoyed building and
                thinking this project, so time well spent in my book!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Hope you too will enjoy &lt;a href="//mataroa.blog"&gt;Mataroa.blog&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;– Theodore&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>City state as code</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/city-state-as-code/</link>
            <description>&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In computing, state is a set of properties that define an entity.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="city-state"&gt;City state&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;People live in cities. People might want to improve their cities. To improve something, one
                ought to know what is wrong with it in the first place. And quite possible, to identify faults, one
                should be aware of large parts of the whole, rather than a small part, i.e. the neighbourhood one
                lives.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Thinking in terms of the functional programming paradigm, the current city state is the
                &lt;em&gt;input&lt;/em&gt;, the desirable state the &lt;em&gt;output&lt;/em&gt;, and the work we need to
                do to get there is the &lt;em&gt;function&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If one wants to improve a city, they would need to know the city state. This implies storing
                the city state, and communicating the city state.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Cities have massive amounts of different entities. Sorting by generality descending, a city
                includes boroughs, neighbourhoods, houses, blocks of flats, parks, trains, buses, cars, roads, and of
                course people, families, companies, offices, industries; the list goes on. Thus, to represent or express
                city state, a need for a structured representation of all this data becomes apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="hope"&gt;Hope&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;What if we could somehow structure, model, and store all these entities of a city? Then we
                could also model the future desired state, and calculate the diff.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We could have a board with CIPs, City Improvement Proposals. Anybody could draft proposals and
                submit them for review by the city council. Some would get accepted and implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Fellow citizens could prioritize and judge others' CIPs, implementing the CIP peer review
                process.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Council and mayor performance assessment would be easier. Metrics on how many proposals were
                submitted, considered, accepted, and implemented would be easily attainable. Elections would be more
                efficient, vote decisions more straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It could lead to a democratization of mayor canditateships. It is common for candidates to
                build their career based on nepotism and reputable schools. By having a transparent system like this, we
                could identify and judge potential new candidates based on their prior CIP work, an actual portrayal of
                pragmatic work for the public. Whether they were born in poor areas or only 16 years ago would be
                irrelevant; what would matter: the actual —evident— achievements, the contribution into the
                seen-by-everybody board of proposals that, &lt;em&gt;hopefully&lt;/em&gt;, represents the
                truth.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;That would be fun. If only we could model city state. The only obstacle towards a more
                efficient city-governance mechanism!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;No?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="despair"&gt;Despair&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;No, not at all. A multitude of problems would appear before us. Even if we exclude the
                challenge of the systematic process of capturing the city state entities, many issues remain.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Most probably, people (unless Swiss&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref"
                href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) will not be interested in submitting any proposals. Hard work
                will be required to inspire them. Likewise, for instilling in them the idea of an objective evaluation
                for the peer effort. Of course, all those, in the context of society-centered interest, rather than
                individual.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Onwards to the administrators' front, bureaucracy would embrace the idea with its embalmed
                arms. And after navigating through that, the genuineness of a CIP's outcome report would be impossible
                to confirm, or improve. Not to mention the complicated, yet completely unexplored, merit-based system
                for approving CIPs. Appropriate motivation, lack of bribery, honesty of the CIP approving commitee — all
                hard fights.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;And then nepotism. The processes that helped it crystallize are not visible even in the current
                system. These shadow structures will take new forms and shapes, and will continue to exist unless
                directly addressed. Separate, additional effort required.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Finally, age, gender, wealth and all other stereotypes and isms will not die that
                easilly.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="truth"&gt;Truth&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It's hopeless, one could say. So much for painting a utopia — it has now been destroyed. There
                is no point talking about any of these, much less implementing them.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I hope the point of the above is now visible: the juxtaposition of these two
                (categories of) outcomes is the truth, and will continue to be the truth. What is more important is
                whether this &lt;em&gt;function&lt;/em&gt; approaches the limit of plus infinity rather than minus
                infinity. Because, if it's not heading towards plus, it's heading towards minus. What I mean is, if we
                are not &lt;em&gt;making&lt;/em&gt; it head towards plus, it's heading towards minus.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;And that's all there is to it. So much, that one could even say this article is not about
                cities, but rather, all humanity's activities.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
                &lt;hr&gt;
                &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;An assumption, only via a brief encounter of the Swiss capital and its citizens.&amp;#160;&lt;a

                text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ol&gt;

            <title>In defense of mind-executed algorithms</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/in-defense-of-mind-executed-algorithms/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time there was a programming course in Imagined Pascal. In this course,
                the exercises were exclusively algorithmic. To solve them, you couldn't use a computer. This was an
                imagined language after all. You could only use your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It seemed unintelligent and in vain to run programs in your mind. The computer could run them
                in milliseconds and verify the unmistakable correctness of the solutions instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But lately I have been thinking that when I was taking that course, I enjoyed programming more
                than ever. Isn't it weird? By using only paper and mind, I had to think exactly what the code would do,
                every possible scenario, with every possible value of every variable. As there was no compiler to catch
                me, I could get away running my potentially wrong execution path. But gradually testing all the
                execution paths when some of them were wrong was more fun when the compiler wasn't there to scream at me
                for not catching all possible trails from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The final ingredient of this type of entertainment is the existence of a teacher. The guarantee
                that one couldn't get away with a non-exhaustive mind execution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Atom Heart Mother</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/atom-heart-mother/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Pink Floyd’s epic masterpiece in an out-of-this-world cover, by the Japanese cover
                band &lt;a href="http://pinkfloydtrips.com/"&gt;GENSHI SHINBO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqcNqRA07yQ"&gt;【Live】原始神母2016「Atom Heart
                Mother」(pinkfloyd tribute)@161027Chicken George&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theme from an Imaginary Western&lt;/em&gt;. Progressive symphonic perfection. Such is
                the transcendence, that the band has been now criticizing this piece of their work, many years after its
                release.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Inspired by a pregnant woman who had been fitted with a heart peacemaker, Atom Heart Mother
                provokes the subject of sapiens-made devices enabling the —still?— unexplained miracle of this world:
                life, soul, consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Lyrics:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Fah&lt;br&gt;
                See co ba&lt;br&gt;
                Nee toe&lt;br&gt;

                Ba sa coo, ba sa coo &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Ba sa coo, ba sa coo&lt;br&gt;
                Oo&lt;br&gt;
                Ku-ku loo, ku-ku loo&lt;br&gt;
                Yea yea yea um &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Hm ku-ku loo you&lt;br&gt;
                Too boo coo doo&lt;br&gt;
                Foo goo hoo joo&lt;br&gt;
                Loo moo poo roo &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Here is a loud announcement &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Silence in the studio! &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Apart from the two lyrics in English, all other are spoken out of authentic exclamation for the
                duality of our nature in the cosmos; thus the absence of any specific language, and the presence of the
                universe-al one.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;From animals and early humans stems the intrinsic notion of survival; eat, live. However,
                starting with societies of just 3 millennia ago, we concern our minds with questions such as humanity’s
                purpose, or the will of the gods. Our lives are drawn between the edges of “wake up, eat, sleep” and
                “commit suicide because you have no purpose”. These are the reflections of the aforementioned duality,
                and &lt;em&gt;Atom Heart Mother&lt;/em&gt;, an ode to this absurdity that perpetuates our lives ad
                infinitum, achieves something nobody else has achieved: the musical manifestation of humanity’s desired
                cosmic balance.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Fuckin’ A.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Tax systems in the spirit of Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/tax-systems-in-the-spirit-of-tractatus-logico-philosophicus/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus"&gt;Tractatus
                Logico-Philosophicus&lt;/a&gt;, and assuming we axiomatize the definitions of:
                &lt;code&gt;person&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ability&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;quality&lt;/code&gt;,
                &lt;code&gt;material&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;authority&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt;,
                &lt;code&gt;government&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;wealth&lt;/code&gt;, we can argue the
                following.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;People want to live with people.&lt;br&gt;
                1.1. When people live with people they form societies.&lt;br&gt;
                1.2. When people form societies, they want to prosper in economic, intellectual, emotional, creative
                (ECIE) ways.&lt;br&gt;
                1.21. When people form societies, they want authoritative equality.&lt;br&gt;
                1.3. Not all people have the same quality of abilities.&lt;br&gt;
                1.4. People want for all people to achieve ECIE prosperity.&lt;br&gt;
                1.5. For people to achieve ECIE prosperity, they need to have high quality of abilities.&lt;br&gt;
                1.5. Not all people have high quality of abilities.&lt;br&gt;
                1.6. Not all people can achieve ECIE prosperity.&lt;br&gt;
                1.7. People want to help people who cannot achieve ECIE prosperity by themselves, achieve ECIE
                prosperity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;People are fond of materials.&lt;br&gt;
                2.1. Societies need a system for materials.&lt;br&gt;
                2.2. Earth's societies' materials system is capitalism.&lt;br&gt;
                2.21. In capitalism, state governments and high wealth bodies have authority.&lt;br&gt;
                2.22. In capitalism, higher wealth means higher authority.&lt;br&gt;
                2.3. State governments act with the intent of equality in societies.&lt;br&gt;
                2.4. State governments act with the intent of wealth redistribution in societies.&lt;br&gt;
                2.5. Tax systems redistribute wealth.&lt;br&gt;
                2.51. Wealth redistribution is a method for attaining change in the economic balance of
                societies.&lt;br&gt;
                2.6. Taxes are defined as a percentage of bodies' wealth that is being allocated for
                redistribution.&lt;br&gt;
                2.61. State governments are in charge of defining societies' tax percentage.&lt;br&gt;
                2.62. State governments are in charge of collecting societies' tax percentage.&lt;br&gt;
                2.63. State governments are in charge of redistributing societies' tax.&lt;br&gt;
                2.7. Higher tax percentages mean higher wealth redistribution.&lt;br&gt;
                2.71. Higher wealth redistribution means higher ability for change in the economic balance of
                societies.&lt;br&gt;
                2.72. Higher ability for change in the economic balance of societies means higher ability for change in
                the authoritative balance of societies.&lt;br&gt;
                2.8. Higher tax percentages are more beneficial for societies towards ECIE prosperity.&lt;br&gt;
                2.9. Higher tax percentages are more beneficial for societies towards authoritative
                equality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;People want tax systems.&lt;br&gt;
                3.1. People want higher tax percentages in tax systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ol&gt;</description>

            <title>Website philosophy</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/website-philosophy/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;There is an increasing amount of people that complain about people not having personal
                websites anymore. Social media make it easier for people to voice their thoughts there, and there are a
                lot of reasons not to trust them. Even in spite of that, I really like the indie personal websites and
                blogs of people. Especially the informational ones, which seem to have faded away completely.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Here are a couple from the old times:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kenrockwell.com/"&gt;https://www.kenrockwell.com/&lt;/a&gt; –
                Invaluable resource for photographers.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sheldonbrown.com/"&gt;https://www.sheldonbrown.com/&lt;/a&gt; –
                Invaluable resource for bicyclists and especially fixed gear.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As for personal blogs, here are three favourite of the current era, with very interesting
                essays on various topics:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gwern.net/"&gt;https://www.gwern.net/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://patrickcollison.com/"&gt;https://patrickcollison.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://sivers.org/"&gt;https://sivers.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;On the same note, I recently read &lt;a
                href="https://24ways.org/2019/its-time-to-get-personal/"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a
                href="https://laurakalbag.com/"&gt;Laura Kalbag&lt;/a&gt;. The part about no tracking sparked the idea
                of stating the philosophy of this site too. It follows below.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="no-tracking"&gt;No tracking&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Zero tracking, no analytics. Eliminating both ad distributors and reading vanity metrics. Even
                when it becomes tempting to learn whether this sentence has been read by anybody at all!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="fast-loading"&gt;Fast loading&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;All pages are smaller than 100KB, putting this at the top 1% of all websites in terms of
                loading speed. It was too easy to make a website this fast, and this highlights one of the problems of
                today's web.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="minimalistic-design"&gt;Minimalistic design&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This design started from copying &lt;a
                href="https://patrickcollison.com/"&gt;patrickcollison.com&lt;/a&gt;. It was notably easy to read, and I
                realized small fonts, no stylistic distractions, and the presentation of raw content were key
                ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="no-fancy-features"&gt;No fancy features&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Zero JavaScript was a principle in the beginning too, but decided not to be dogmatic and
                embrace a couple of dozens KB for easily adding &lt;a
                href="https://github.com/posativ/isso"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; with all the nice features, such as
                completely anonymous posting and optional eponymity.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="public-domain"&gt;Public domain&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://freedomdefined.org/Definition"&gt;free culture&lt;/a&gt; license. All

            <title>In loving memory of governments</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/in-loving-memory-of-governments/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;A month ago, I read the following news title&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a
                class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alaska governor asks Elon Musk to build the Cybertruck in his
                state&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It used to be that corporations ought to follow the letter of the law that governments set, and
                that letter existed to protect the citizens&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref"
                href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Now, political governors ask, not as in command, but as in beg,
                the leaders of corporations, to help them. As if they say: "You are the king and wherever you install
                your wealth maker, that place will bloom. Please install it at our place."&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;National governments didn't do such a great job over the last decades, so why not let
                corporations show the way now?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, corporations care about exactly one thing: to have a greater profit than last
                year. Same profit, however ludicrous it might be, isn't going to work; it must be higher. This
                economic-profit-über-ales tactic already causes the deepest of problems on a societal level. By having
                corporations rule on a country level, we invite economic inequality to rise more and faster&lt;sup
                id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is hardly the first instance of this issue. Amazon, in 2017, announced their plan to build
                their second HQ, and then invited governments to bid (!) using tax breaks. Amazon is one of the world's
                most valuable companies, and its founder the richest man alive. Not only can they afford to pay all
                their taxes, but they should pay to contribute as much as they can in the government budget for the
                public.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In our economic paradigm, avoiding taxes is success. Sadly, too, the richer someone is, the
                easier it is to avoid taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Had we cared about the status quo of centralized government and its merits we might have
                considered that paying taxes is nobility, generosity, and virtue. We might have also celebrated that
                companies actually care about public healthcare and pensions. I dream of having a public scoreboard that
                will rank both companies and individuals of how much money they contribute in excess of the required,
                source of great respect from peers and favored. Instead, what we consider an accomplishment is not
                paying taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The unsustainability of unregulated capitalism on an economic level matches perfectly that of
                the environmental level. People will die, both from poverty and from extreme storms, while the tres
                commas club members emerge victorious at the final boss battle in the golden age of individualism: that
                of finally being alone.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
                &lt;hr&gt;
                &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a
                href="https://www.xautoworld.com/tesla/alaska-governor-cybertruck/"&gt;https://www.xautoworld.com/tesla/alaska-governor-cybertruck/&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a
                class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the
                text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;At least that was the impression I had when I grew up, in Greece.&amp;#160;&lt;a
                class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the
                text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It's not totally unrelated that even Elon Musk proposed to privatize Tesla, possibly to get rid
                of the profit &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence#Paperclip_maximizer"&gt;maximizers&lt;/a&gt;,
                hence focusing on actual product building.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3"
                title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ol&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;</description>

            <title>City-level democracy enhancements</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/city-level-democracy-enhancements/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: Some of the following ideas, in different forms, exist in various
                countries. This is from my personal perspective in Thessaloniki, Greece.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Democracy &amp;larr; demo- (“people”) + -cracy (“rule”).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In contrast to the present day, democracy in classical Athens meant direct democracy. There was
                no concept of indirect (representative) democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Let's re-define democracy as a gradient. An example of ultimate, 100% pure, democracy would
                mean that every person being affected by a decision has taken part in its making. On the other hand, a
                most inferior example, 0% democracy, would mean that only one person makes decisions for everybody, e.g.
                dictatorship.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="urban-psephocracy"&gt;Urban psephocracy&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Using the above definition, representative democracy falls somewhere in between, though
                definitely closer to the side of 100% democracy rather than 0%. This level of democracy should be
                improved, however, this is not necessarily something that citizens want. Cities are expected to work as
                services. By paying taxes, people expect that the state (or mayorship) will fulfill their needs
                no-questions-asked. Though needs are very different per person, there are some universally accepted,
                such as infrastructure-related ones. For example, everyone would vote in favor of nice parks, well-built
                roads and pavements, parking facilities, policing, et al.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;City societies play a major role in one’s life. The interaction between citizens is important
                in the metric of culture quality. One could say this is just a matter of culture aesthetics and not
                objective quality. However, what if we turned the previous idea of cities-as-services upside down? Let's
                call it "citizens as city makers". Citizens could take part in the matters of the city as actively as
                the city council. Everybody would contribute actively to the evolution of the city, people would
                communicate with fellow citizens, and the percentage of the demoracy gradient would significantly
                rise.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In addition to the above argument, there are certain issues arising in systems implementing
                representative democracy that would be improved with the "citizens as city makers" proposal.
                Indicatively:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;The only point in time citizens make any decision regarding the whole is the day of the
                elections. This is an extremely rare event, once every four or five years.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Citizens do not spend time studying the policies or plans of the candidates in order to find
                the best solution for the whole city.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Citizens have no strong opinions or opinions whatsoever, on current issues, yet they are
                mandated to vote.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Citizens do not perform retrospective analysis of the candidates to improve their voting
                skills.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Citizens prefer to vote in favor of someone who shields their own interests even when this
                harms the majority's interests.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The idea of "citizens as city makers" is, of course, very far away for the major urban centres
                of the west. Towards reducing this distance, an overview of three practical ideas follows.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="postal-code-groups"&gt;Postal code groups&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;An online forum-like application where citizen groups discuss issues they face in the city.
                Cities can have large populations, thus discussions can become awfully difficult. To counter that, let
                groups be divided by postal codes. Citizens will communicate with public written messages posted at the
                postal code group forum. The content of these messages can range from menial tasks such as fixing broken
                garbage bins and street lamps to very momentous ones, like creating pocket parks and organizing culture
                festivals.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Detailing further, the application's sophistication can contribute to the quality of the
                implementation of the aforementioned tasks and projects. For example, the application can bother the
                person or people in charge of the venture to provide updates on how it is progressing. This will
                contribute to transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="borough-assemblies"&gt;Borough assemblies&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The purpose of borough assemblies is to re-create the idea of agora. Having a general assembly
                where every citizen can meet and discuss is a core notion of democratic systems. Nowadays, citizens
                never meet each other with the purpose of discussing city matters. This is the exact opposite of how a
                democratic system should work.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Cities are divided into boroughs. In order to make an assembly more manageable we can use this
                concept and divide city assemblies to borough assemblies. Also, instead of weekly meetings, monthly ones
                can be more feasible&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref"
                href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="cognizant-elections"&gt;Cognizant elections&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As it was previously discussed, elections are highly inefficient and fail to meet any quality
                standard. Various ways need to be devised for their improvement. One domain is information. Most
                citizens are never acquainted with even the names (let alone the actual plans) of candidate mayors. This
                is absurd as the basis of representative democracy is that every voter chooses the candidate with whom
                they agree the most; how could they if they have not listened to them?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;An official informational website that includes plans of all candidates could contribute
                correct&amp;mdash;a tiny bit&amp;mdash;this beyond ludicrous yet completely accepted state of
                affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="case-study"&gt;Case study&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is an example of how these ideas can help improve the state of a city.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the city of Thessaloniki, Greece, the following has happened repeatedly: a thief steals
                someone's bag from a restaurant. The police, using the restaurant's cameras, identify the thief, and
                respond that this is a known thief, who gets caught regularly by them. However, the prosecutor releases
                the thief the following day. Even if a particular thief goes in jail for a few months, they will return
                to their theiving life soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is a bizarre situation that transpires because of citizens' detachedness and centralized
                laws, which are destined to work on all scenarios, country or continent-wide (reading between the lines:
                EU).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Using the ideas of borough assemblies and postal code groups, local citizens that experience
                this situation can contribute actively to this problem. My expectation is that their action would be
                much more effective because it would be much more focused, in contrast to a solution from a centralized
                government that is required to create one law to cover all cases.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I always thought something was fundamentally wrong with the
                universe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                &amp;ndash; Douglas Adams&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It is expected that this text has had more of a detrimental effect to one's belief on the
                possible success of democracy rather than beneficial. This truth becomes even more apparent when the
                proposals of this text are actually implemented. Yet, absence of despair is recommended, as this is a
                one-way street: nihilism is deprecated.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>The Wall by Pink Floyd</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/the-wall-by-pink-floyd/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall&lt;/em&gt; is Pink Floyd’s eleventh album.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="history"&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animals&lt;/em&gt; is Pink Floyd's tenth album. They had already met huge success
                with &lt;em&gt;Dark Side of the Moon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Wish You Were Here&lt;/em&gt;, both of
                them written by the band as a whole. However, &lt;em&gt;Animals&lt;/em&gt; was written mainly by Roger
                Waters. This fact made the rest of the band unhappy. After that, it wasn't long until Roger would go to
                their live concerts by himself and leave as soon as they were over. The others were dissapointed with
                the situation and felt the band didn’t have much else to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;At the final performance of the Animals tour (namely, &lt;em&gt;In The Flesh&lt;/em&gt; tour)
                at Montreal, Roger Waters felt extremely annoyed when a fan climbed up to the stage and verbally
                professed his love for the band. At that point, Roger decided to spit on this man’s face. This incident,
                ever after known as &lt;em&gt;The Spitting Incident&lt;/em&gt;, was the basis for the
                Brobdingnagian-proportions magnum opus that followed.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;That night, Roger, realized he had built a wall between the performers and the audience. He
                shared those thoughts with the band’s producer Bob Ezrin and Bob’s psychiatrist friend. He also
                recognized the dominance of this self-imposed isolation to himself and identified its roots in his life.
                This served as primary inspiration for the band’s next record, one imperatively needed as their less
                than ideal money management skills had just surfaced.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Roger wrote the next album by himself. His relationship with the other members kept decaying.
                Especially, between him and Richard Wright, the keyboardist of the band. Richard couldn’t keep up with
                the tight recording schedule that Roger had set up and more tension led to Richard leaving the band just
                before the record gets completed.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;These circumstances, an utmost irony given the theme of the album, were the emotional context
                when &lt;em&gt;The Wall&lt;/em&gt; was released.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="theme"&gt;Theme&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall&lt;/em&gt; is a concept album that revolves around isolation. It delves into
                the life of imaginary character &lt;em&gt;Pink&lt;/em&gt;. Pink’s father—like Roger’s—was killed in a
                war. This is the initial brick that forms the metaphorical wall of isolation. Additional bricks include
                Pink’s overprotective mother (Track 6, &lt;em&gt;Mother&lt;/em&gt;) and his abusive teachers (Track 4,
                &lt;em&gt;Happiest Days of Our Lives&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But in the town, it was well known&lt;br&gt;
                When they got home at night, their fat and&lt;br&gt;
                Psychopathic wives would thrash them&lt;br&gt;
                Within inches of their lives &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;All 26 tracks are intensely dramatic and visual. They range greatly in music style, from hard
                rock to opera, while they also get deeply dark (e.g. Track 7, &lt;em&gt;Goodbye Blue
                Sky&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As mentioned, the concept of the album is almost biographical. Except himself, Roger, also
                bases Pink on Syd Barrett. Syd was one of the founding members of Pink Floyd, as well as the original
                lead singer and principal songwriter. Syd was a heavy user of LSD and along with his seemingly
                schizophrenic behavior (hallucinations, memory lapses, mood swings), he was unable to fulfill his role
                as band member. While he was ousted after the second album, the band didn’t abandon him. Except for
                writing albums about him (&lt;em&gt;Wish You Were Here&lt;/em&gt;) they also tried to help him in his
                solo music endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The biographical nature of this art piece is part of the reason that it portraits a life
                journey so humane, so broken, so messed up and run down, that makes you wonder just how good music can
                be.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a
                href="https://youtu.be/iLFwTqdsuxw?list=PLyDzU3p8FP24syYfTXpGqTDHsQhlxwllS&amp;amp;t=94"&gt;So ya
                thought ya might like to go to the show&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                To feel the warm thrill of confusion, that space cadet glow&lt;br&gt;
                Tell me is something eluding you, sunshine?&lt;br&gt;
                Is this not what you expected to see?&lt;br&gt;
                If you wanna find out what's behind these cold eyes&lt;br&gt;
                You'll just have to claw your way through this disguise &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall&lt;/em&gt; is a double album. The first half builds the wall up, while the
                second half breaks it down.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;After Pink hides behind his wall in the second half of the album, he becomes severely
                depressed. Unable to function he turns to drugs, as is poetically confessed in &lt;em&gt;Comfortably
                Numb&lt;/em&gt;, a fan favorite. Finally, on the penultimate track &lt;em&gt;The Trial&lt;/em&gt;, he
                puts himself on trial and gets judged by the past, evil, “brick manifestations” of his life.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The judge and fellow trial attendees order him: “Tear down the wall”. He does, and this is
                when, the final piece, &lt;em&gt;Outside the Wall&lt;/em&gt; begins:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4ZlWEQ17ns&amp;amp;list=PLyDzU3p8FP24syYfTXpGqTDHsQhlxwllS&amp;amp;index=26"&gt;All
                alone, or in twos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                The ones who really love you&lt;br&gt;
                Walk up and down outside the wall&lt;br&gt;
                Some hand in hand&lt;br&gt;
                And some gathered together in bands&lt;br&gt;
                The bleeding hearts and the artists&lt;br&gt;
                Make their stand&lt;br&gt;
                And when they’ve given you their all&lt;br&gt;
                Some stagger and fall, after all it’s not easy&lt;br&gt;
                Banging your heart against some mad bugger’s wall &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="epilogue"&gt;Epilogue&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I would love to make the understatement of labeling this album as the greatest of the 20th
                century. But I can’t; because as I listen to &lt;em&gt;Outside the Wall&lt;/em&gt; ending, I can only
                characterize it as the greatest cultural piece I have ever experienced.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Introduction to plain text accounting</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/introduction-to-plain-text-accounting/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Being too broke until yesterday, I decided it's high time to get on top of my
                financial situation.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This, among other items, involves keeping close track of how much money I have and spend. But,
                how do this? It would certainly be a shame to miss this chance to use something hacker-worthy.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="enter-plain-text-accounting"&gt;Enter plain text accounting&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the past, I have tried numerous times to keep track of my personal finances. All those
                times, after one or two months, I had given up. It would be too tedious to keep track or even care how
                much money I spend when I am not broke.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Attempted methods include simple spreadsheets, multiple web and/or mobile apps, even spending
                only from one bank account so as to have everything centralized and easily analyzable. For some reason
                or another all of them stopped working.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But now I'm sure I have found the pinnacle of accounting: plain text accounting!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It is of undeniable certainty that this method too, will fail. Until then, here is its
                story.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="ledger-cli-hledger-beancount-abandon"&gt;Ledger-cli, hledger, beancount, abandon&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;All those are names of super cool software that does plain text accounting. But first, a
                definition:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Plain text accounting is accounting software with database a plain text file.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;So no database of the SQL kind. Instead, old school paper accounting with new school digital
                digits.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The first obstacle I faced in my Plain Text Accouting Journey (PTAJ from now on) was the
                decision of which software I should choose. Ledger-cli is the historically first PTA software, appearing
                in 2003 and written in C++; but hledger is written in cool Haskell. And beancount is written in Python,
                with easily pluggable web interface and nice charts and visualizations. Deadlock.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;After several minutes I settled on ledger-cli. The documentation and the input method was
                seemingly the simplest to get started. Furthermore, it seems data can easily be exchanged between each
                other of those, so I can switch easily — if need be.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="getting-started"&gt;Getting started&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I loved the brutal simplicity of &lt;a href="https://www.ledger-cli.org/"&gt;ledger-cli's
                website&lt;/a&gt; and at the same time was shocked with the abundance of information on their &lt;a
                href="https://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html"&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;. However, I had already
                realized that I had learned enough (in the software comparison phase) to be able to cover my bookkeeping
                needs, so who cares about reading any more docs.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;For one to get started in their PTAJ, they need to reflect their current financial state in a
                plain text file. I created a file named &lt;code&gt;ledger.txt&lt;/code&gt; with the following
                content:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;2019/09/14 * Opening Balance
                Assets:Checking $1000.73
                Liabilities:MasterCard -$200.60
                Equity:Opening Balances
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This means I have 1000 dollars in my checking bank account and I owe 200 dollars for my credit
                card borrowing performance. And this is all the money I have and owe.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I later learned what &lt;code&gt;Equity:Opening Balances&lt;/code&gt; meant. It was the most
                rocky part of my PTAJ, and I believe everyone's, so I'll leave it for now.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Let's see the results of our work so far. Running in the command line:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ledger -f ledger.txt balance
                $1000.73 Assets:Checking
                $-800.13 Equity:Opening Balances
                $-200.60 Liabilities:MasterCard
                --------------------
                0
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Not much. Let's say I eat out; I then add this entry in my file:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;2019/09/10 * Pizza
                Expenses:Food $10.00
                Assets:Checking -$10.00
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Running:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ledger -f ledger.txt balance checking
                $990.73 Assets:Checking
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As you can see, we spent 10 dollars in a pizza, and our clever software knew what to subtract
                and is kind enough to let us know of the result. &lt;code&gt;Expenses:Food&lt;/code&gt; is a sub-account
                of the &lt;code&gt;Expenses&lt;/code&gt; top-level account. &lt;a
                href="https://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html#Structuring-your-Accounts"&gt;According to the
                ledger-cli docs&lt;/a&gt;, there are five top-level accounts:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Expenses: where money goes&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Assets: where money sits&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Income: where money comes from&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Liabilities: money you owe&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Equity: the real value of your property (&lt;em&gt;confusing&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Another example:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;2019/09/10 * Amazon frenzy
                Expenses $350.00
                Liabilities:MasterCard -$350.00
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I used my credit card to pay at Amazon, which I sorted that under the
                &lt;code&gt;Liabilities&lt;/code&gt; account - it's money that I now owe.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;You have now learned basics of ledger-cli. I did think this was enough knowledge to enable my
                future affluence, but the PTAJ was too fun to stop. For instance, the following entry is equivalent to
                the above:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;2019/09/10 * Amazon frenzy
                Expenses $350.00
                Liabilities:MasterCard
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Every entry needs to be balanced (as in sum equals zero). Thus, if you omit an obvious part,
                the software will fill it for you. Though, only in its mind; it will never alter the text
                file.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="single-entry-vs-double-entry-accounting"&gt;Single-entry vs double-entry
                accounting&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Single-entry accounting is the obvious, straight-forward way someone would keep track of
                expenses. e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;I have 100 dollars in my wallet&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;I paid 10 dollars for a pizza&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;I now have 90 dollars in my wallet&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ol&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;All records follow one thread, keeping track of one number.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Double-entry accounting keeps track of multiple numbers. Also, it always keeps track of the
                source and the destination of the money being transferred. The accounting lingo is
                &lt;code&gt;credit&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;debit&lt;/code&gt;. Now, every time there is a change in
                the numbers we keep track of, we update them. Since a change is a transfer from one to another, we will
                always update (at least) two accounts. However, every entry must be balanced — equal amount of money
                needs to be at the source and at the destination. We can neither create money out of thin air, nor make
                it disappear. Money has to come from somewhere and go somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is the point of the &lt;code&gt;Equity:Opening Balances&lt;/code&gt; account. It is a
                sub-account of our &lt;code&gt;equity&lt;/code&gt;, "the real value of our property", useful for
                explaining from where our money comes from when we start our bookkeeping records.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="budgeting"&gt;Budgeting&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Keeping a budget might be one of the main benefits for the pain of maintaining a double-entry
                accounting system for personal finances. Here is how it's done in ledger-cli.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To set a budget you need to set a &lt;code&gt;periodic transaction&lt;/code&gt; (notice the
                tilde). At the top of your &lt;code&gt;ledger.txt&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~ Monthly
                Expenses:Food $300.00
                Assets:Checking
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This says that we can spend at most $450 in the &lt;code&gt;Expenses:Food&lt;/code&gt; account,
                per month.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Assuming our &lt;code&gt;ledger.txt&lt;/code&gt; is this:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~ Monthly
                Expenses:Food $300.00
                Assets:Checking

                2019/09/10 * Food part one
                Expenses:Food $100.0
                Assets:Checking
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Then:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ledger -f ledger.txt --budget balance food
                $-200.00 Expenses:Food
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This means we can spend $200 for food.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Let's assume a few days we spend more on food, and our &lt;code&gt;ledger.txt&lt;/code&gt;
                becomes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~ Monthly
                Expenses:Food $300.00
                Assets:Checking

                2019/09/10 * Food part one
                Expenses:Food $100.0
                Assets:Checking

                2019/09/20 * Food part two
                Expenses:Food $250.0
                Assets:Checking
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Then:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ledger -f ledger.txt --budget balance food
                $50.00 Expenses:Food
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This command tells us we are over our &lt;code&gt;Expenses:Food&lt;/code&gt; budget by
                $50.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="limit-reporting-by-date"&gt;Limit reporting by date&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Ledger-cli, by default, reads the whole file when reporting. This is pretty useless since one
                will need to keep track mostly monthly (or even yearly) expenses. There are many ways to limit the date
                of reporting. One of them is by using &lt;code&gt;-b&lt;/code&gt; (beging) and
                &lt;code&gt;-e&lt;/code&gt; (end).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ledger -f ledger.txt -b 2019-09-01 -e 2019-09-31 --budget balance food
                $50.00 Expenses:Food
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Another way is &lt;code&gt;-p&lt;/code&gt;, which is more flexible. E.g.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ledger -f ledger.txt register groceries -p &amp;quot;this month&amp;quot;
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Or &lt;code&gt;last month&lt;/code&gt;. Or:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ledger -f ledger.txt register groceries -p &amp;quot;sep 2019&amp;quot;
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="more-ptaj-fun"&gt;More PTAJ fun&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/jwiegley"&gt;John Wiegley&lt;/a&gt; et al have been developing
                ledger-cli for 16 years. Unsurprisingly, it has many tricks up its sleeve. Let's explore a
                few.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h3 id="cleared-and-pending-transactions"&gt;Cleared and pending transactions&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;You may have noticed an asterisk (&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;) between the date and the name of
                the entry in the examples. It's purpose is not to separate the two, it could be omitted. It's meaning in
                the ledger-cli system is signifying a cleared transaction. There is also the exclamation mark
                (&lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;), which signifies a pending transaction. &lt;a
                href="https://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html#Transactions-and-Comments"&gt;According to the
                documentation&lt;/a&gt; you have to choose for yourself what "cleared" and "pending" transactions mean.
                I found no value and ignored for the first hours of my PTAJ, but later I realized I can use them for
                payments that I will do in the near future and thus don't want these money to appear as available for
                spending.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h3 id="unit-price"&gt;Unit price&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Another enjoyable trick is setting a unit price. Let's say you buy a few apples, and pay per
                apple:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;2019/09/11 * Farmer's Market
                Expenses:Food 10 apples @ $0.30
                Assets:Checking
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Ledger-cli can calculate how much you paid, and subtract it from the checking
                account.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Maybe though, you know the final price but not the unit price. In that case, you can do
                that:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;2019/09/11 * Farmer's Market
                Expenses:Food 10 apples @@ $3.00
                Assets:Checking
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                &lt;h3 id="stock"&gt;Stock&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Ledger-cli supports a concept called commodities, which enables us to record &lt;a
                href="https://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html#Buying-and-Selling-Stock"&gt;buying and selling
                stock&lt;/a&gt;. Let's buy some Apple shares:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;2019/09/13 Stock purchase
                Assets:Broker 10 AAPL @ $218.75
                Expenses:Broker:Commissions $20.00
                Assets:Broker $-2,207.50
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                &lt;h3 id="strict-mode"&gt;Strict mode&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;One day you write this entry:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;2019/09/10 * Supermarket
                Expenses $50.00
                Liabilities:MatserCard
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed, there is a typo.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, no one will complain. Ledger-cli will consider MatserCard a brand new account.
                Hence, leaving your balance completely off.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, there is a way to prevent this. Firstly, you need to statically define all your
                accounts like this, in the beginning of your text file:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;account Equity:Opening Balances
                account Assets:Checking
                account Income:Salary
                account Liabilities:MasterCard
                account Expenses:Food
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;And secondly, you need to use the &lt;code&gt;--strict&lt;/code&gt; in your CLI commands. E.g.
                &lt;code&gt;ledger -f ledger.txt balance checking --strict&lt;/code&gt;. Consequently, if there is an
                undefined account &lt;a
                href="https://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html#Keeping-it-Consistent"&gt;ledger-cli will
                complain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h3 id="bitbar-plugin"&gt;BitBar Plugin&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Here is a tiny &lt;a href="https://getbitbar.com/"&gt;BitBar&lt;/a&gt; plugin, in case you want
                to be reminded all the time how much money you have.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div style="background: #fdf6e3;"&gt;&lt;pre style=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;# Display balance of accounts, using ledger-cli&lt;/span&gt;

            <title>On Satoshi</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/on-satoshi/</link>
            <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;"I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted
                third party."&lt;br&gt;
                - Satoshi Nakamoto &amp;lt;satoshi&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;@vistomail.com&amp;gt; &lt;a
                href="http://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-October/014810.html"&gt;Fri Oct 31 14:10:00
                EDT 2008&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I'm irresistibly amazed at the technological marvel of Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As if the programmer of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis"&gt;our
                simulation&lt;/a&gt; descended in their virtual creation with the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. They lived 2
                human years, created something that will change the course of humanity, and then reascended back out our
                universe and into "reality".&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The timeline is eerily elegant:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Aug 2008: bitcoin.org domain registration.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Oct 2008: Satoshi posts on cryptography@metzdowd.com one of the most legendary papers of all
                time, then titled: &lt;em&gt;Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Jan 2009: Satoshi releases Bitcoin v0.1 on Sourceforge and mines the genesis block on January
                3, 2009, 18:15:05 UTC.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Nov 2009: Satoshi creates the bitcointalk forum.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Dec 2010: The last we hear of Satoshi. Last active on bitcointalk on December 13, 2010. Same
                day of his final post on the bitcoin mailing list (&lt;em&gt;Bitcoin 0.3.19 is
                released&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks."&lt;br&gt;
                Satoshi's proof that the genesis block was mined no earlier than January 3, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Satoshi was probably male and living in Japan. &lt;a
                href="https://diginomics.com/2013/01/09/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto/"&gt;It has been claimed&lt;/a&gt; that
                when bitcoin.org was registered on August 18, 2008, the registrant used a Japanese anonymous
                registration service, and hosted it using a Japanese ISP.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Regarding the bitcoin code, it has been deemed by the community that his work resembles
                someone's with strong theoretical knowledge of cryptography, probably from academia, rather than a
                software engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Satoshi listed his birthdate as April 5, 1975. Probably a random date, but there is wide
                speculation as to what this date means. Remember, bitcoin conspiracy theory 101: Satoshi does nothing in
                random.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Regardless, according to that birthdate, Satoshi would be 34 years old in 2009. His masterful
                knowledge of C++, cryptography and distributed concepts reveal only part of his genius. What he managed
                via Bitcoin is the use of existing technologies in such a way that he created something so radical that
                changed the journey of current technology. Everybody in tech now talks about blockchain. The reason is
                the work of one person. He devoted—only—2 years of his life for this.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It is, indeed, amazing that every technology Satoshi used as part to form Bitcoin existed for
                years. However, no one had thought to combine them is such a unique way; at least until then.
                Historically, it is common for minds at the forefront of human intelligence to discover the same new
                things independently. Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz independently discovered calculus at the same
                time, in the mid-17th century, a famous instance of the theory.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But, this is not the case for Bitcoin. No one seems to have been close, even though the impact
                of this technology is &lt;a
                href="https://youtu.be/DW9WXMp7RDo?t=87"&gt;Brobdingnagian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I secretly hope the real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto will never be known, thus leaving the
                story of how Bitcoin came to be, an actual legend.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;"I would be surprised if 10 years from now we're not using electronic currency in some way, now
                that we know a way to do it that won't inevitably get dumbed down when the trusted third party gets cold
                feet."&lt;br&gt;

            <title>Introducing Open Cult: Ridiculously minimal open source meetup.com alternative</title>
            <link>
            https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/introducing-open-cult-ridiculously-minimal-open-source-meetup-com-alternative/
            </link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;After the latest redesign meetup.com feels a bit clunky; somehow less usable. I really
                like the idea of Meetup though, so I thought to take a stab at creating an alternative. It will probably
                not meet most people’s aesthetic principles, as it is a bit eccentric, but do see for
                yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href="https://github.com/sirodoht/opencult.com"&gt;Open Cult&lt;/a&gt;, a
                ridiculously minimal, open source, Meetup.com alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The ideas behind Open Cult are based on minimalism, speed, simplicity and a text-only
                approach.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Comparing with Meetup, instead of meetup groups, we have cults, hence the name. The rest of the
                core functionality is the same. You can join a cult; RSVP at an event; leave a cult or
                un-RSVP.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The differences are that you receive exactly one email per event announcement. You receive no
                confirmation email once you RSVPed in contrast to meetup.com; you know you will go, no reason to archive
                one more email.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The design is inspired by YC Hacker News. After using HN for many years I’ve come to appreciate
                its spartan approach. It’s an unpopular opinion (and probably an overreaction for some web design
                trends) but in the case of meetups, I just want the content; no wide margins, no large icons, no images.
                The content is the event title and description, time &amp;amp; date, location, one email reminder when
                the event is announced and maybe a few comments to review the event or clarify details.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Open Cult loads extremely fast. The frontend is currently less than 20KB and everything is
                served with 2 HTTP/2 requests.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As far as mobile responsiveness, a major pain point for me with meetup.com, Open Cult performs
                marvelously. Apart from the Lilliputian size, its barebones HTML elements will use the OS native date
                and time pickers, making new event submissions on mobile a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Finally, Open Cult is built on Python and Django, and &lt;a
                href="https://github.com/sirodoht/opencult.com"&gt;lives on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; as an open source project.
                Please feel free to contribute, as one pair of eyeballs is not nearly enough for all bugs. Also,
                consider proposing and discussing new features and UX-first design improvements. Check some ideas &lt;a

            <title>Rust incremental-difficulty tutorial series</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/rust-incremental-difficulty-tutorial-series/</link>
            <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A response to Rust’s &lt;a
                href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/01/03/new-years-rust-a-call-for-community-blogposts.html"&gt;Call
                for Community Blogposts&lt;/a&gt; #Rust2018&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is a documentation improvement on learning Rust, derived from personal experience after
                picking up Rust and reading the Book v1, a few months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="the-problem"&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;For me picking up a new programming language is hard because finding the successful learning
                path is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The first step is usually obvious, it’s a “Getting started” article on the official docs. This
                includes the basic syntax and concepts. With Rust, the second step is easy too, it’s &lt;a
                href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/"&gt;The Book&lt;/a&gt;. The third step would be to
                write your own thing, to solve a problem of your own; create a small project.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The problems with this are:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;What this project will be&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;How hard it should be&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;How I can learn if the result is low, medium or high quality&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;When learning, and especially when you are new to programming, you may pick up the wrong
                problems to solve with the tools you want to learn. Learning JavaScript by coding mathematical
                computation algorithms might not be the best idea and similarly learning Rust by building web
                applications is not either&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref"
                href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Secondly, you can’t know how hard the problem you want to tackle is when using a new
                programming language&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref"
                href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Coding a mass file renamer might be 10 times more
                time-consuming and difficult in C than in Python&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref"
                href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Thirdly, you can’t assess the result; whether it’s high quality Rust code or not. There might
                be open source clones, but who says they’re better or worse? In contrast with the previous problems,
                this is much harder to overcome, and again, especially if you are a beginner.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To sum up, we need:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;To know the correct problems to solve&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;The level of difficulty of each one&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;The reference solution of an expert&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="the-solution-proposal"&gt;The solution proposal&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Along with the Book and Rust By Example add a series of high quality, Rust-suitable project
                examples.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;These projects’ difficulty could escalate proportionately.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Here is a proposal from someone who doesn’t know Rust:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Hello World&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Poker&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Lite Git clone&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ol&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A Rust learner after completing those will have written a good chunk of Rust LOCs, assess their
                results and improve iteratively!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The requirements of these projects need to be described in detail so the novice can know
                exactly what they will need to create.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;And of course, the solutions of these projects need to be available, heavily commented and
                written with best practices in mind. It should not be the best possible code nor the most efficient,
                probably the most readable and correct, though.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;With these, a Rust learner can refer to exemplary, readable, beginner-friendly code that can
                guide them. Steps after that could be to create step-by-step tutorials for the projects (like the
                existing Guessing Game book chapter), or even screencasts, like &lt;a
                href="https://gophercises.com/"&gt;Gophercises&lt;/a&gt; for Golang.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The existence of official tutorials, part of Rust docs, means that there will be a go-to
                resource for all new users, and a few example projects that will always be up-to-date and available for
                studying.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Well, guessing might work, but we want to improve things here anyway.&amp;#160;&lt;a
                class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the

                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Yes, C might be a more suitable language for this task, but Python is ok for
                learning.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the

            <title>Free will in a deterministic universe</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/free-will-in-a-deterministic-universe/</link>
            <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Originally written in June 2014. Revised and published in September 2017. Thank you,
                @handsomegeorge, for the notes.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this essay is to inform the reader about the philosophical views on the topic of
                free will. The existence of free will, though it may seem as a far-fetched and non-everyday issue, it
                has some very important consequences on our lives. For instance, let’s examine happiness. It is said
                that in order to be happy you need to pick and do the things that you like, things that define you.
                Firstly, though, you have to find what these things are. In order to be sure about these you need to act
                based on your own free will.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Free will has been discussed as an issue since ancient times. This can be considered as an
                indication of its significance. Many philosophers contributed with their views on free will. These
                opinions have been classified into four broad categories, which I will analyze later on.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I deemed appropriate to start my argument with an important, yet not clearly defined concept.
                This is randomness. It may seem simple enough; a random event is one we cannot predict. In order to
                predict an event, you have to observe and measure its causes. This means that if an event’s causes are
                immeasurable then this event is truly random. To elaborate, when a die is thrown, we can neither control
                our hand’s force nor measure any other forces that are being exerted at the die. This inability of ours
                to take exact measurements of all these variables is where we support the argument of the die’s
                randomness. However, this does not mean that these variables are inherently unmeasurable.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Free will initially may feel as a non-issue, but if we give it some thought we will realize it
                is not a simple concept at all. Every action we take has some specific causes. Since, as I showed above,
                there is nothing random then the causes of our actions are not random either. They were also caused by
                some other non-random events. Continuing this way, we can constantly go back until the first event we
                know (or at least assume) that existed: the Big Bang. This is the event that we can picture as the first
                link of a chain. A different Big Bang would result in different subsequent events and thus a different
                chain. This pattern of thinking describes the deterministic view on the universe. In this way, even our
                thoughts, as part of the universe can be described as deterministic, which means that it was inevitable
                for them to happen. We can resonate in the following way: every thought has a trigger-thought behind it
                i.e. a thought that caused it. This trigger-thought has its own triggers-thoughts. Continuing in the
                same way we did with the events, there is one original thought, which in this case is not very important
                because its bearer (a human) is influenced to a great degree by their external environment. The
                universe, though, does not have such external influences — at least, none that we know of.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I mentioned that views on free will are classified into four major categories. These are hard
                determinism, compatibilism, hard incompatibilism, and libertarianism.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If someone adheres to hard determinism then they accept the deterministic view of the universe,
                while they deny the existence of free will. This can be easily understood. Free will is defined as being
                able to make choices unconstrained by certain factors. Nonetheless, a deterministic universe implies
                that any choice you make will be influenced by factors which could not have happened otherwise, and
                actually be predicted. Therefore, free will is incompatible with a deterministic universe.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Compatibilists, on the other hand, claim that free will is indeed compatible with a
                deterministic universe. Arguments for this view can be supported by a different definition of free will.
                Some definitions include that free will means the lack of physical restraints, or that free will is
                defined as dictated by events such as the die throw. This means that randomness is synonymous to
                unpredictability, and since randomness is possible, determinism is not and events that cannot be
                predicted can happen. Another view on this by Daniel Dennett is that if we exclude an omnipotent God
                then because of chaos and epistemic limits on the precision of our knowledge of the current state of the
                world, the future is ill-defined for all finite beings. The only well-defined things are “expectations”,
                which are the choices we have on a specific case and we choose one of them on each case or
                event.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;John Locke, regarded as a proponent of hard incompatibilism claimed that “free will” as a
                phrase is absurd. Contemporary philosopher Galen Strawson, agreeing with Locke, claims that free will is
                impossible because man cannot create himself or his mental states “ex nihilo”, i.e. “out of nothing” in
                Latin. Hard incompatibilists do not agree with the existence of determinism, but they do not necessarily
                imply that the lack of it is in any way correlated to free will.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Another most interesting view, that falls under the umbrella of hard incompatibilism, is by
                Eliezer Yudkowsky, an AI researcher with controversial opinions. As far as free will is concerned, he
                claims it being a cognitive element representing the basic game-theoretical unit of moral
                responsibility. In a way, this means that if someone has free will then we can say he is responsible for
                his physical and mental state. According to Yudkowsky, free will does not exist in reality with the
                common definition we use; it is the representation of the algorithm our mind uses to make decisions. In
                this case, the dilemma I stated: whether free will is possible since determinism implies that everything
                can be predicted, does not stand as a question; free will is irrelevant to determinism.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Libertarianism, the fourth of the major views is a position that argues that free will is
                indeed logically incompatible with a deterministic universe, but humans do have free will, therefore,
                determinism is false. Essentially, libertarians’ arguments merge the notion of free will’s existence of
                compatibilists with the lack of determinism. Robert Kane, one of the leading contemporary philosophers
                on free will, talks about the existence of alternative possibilities, which resembles Dennett’s idea of
                expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Although all arguments about free will are divided into four categories, there is a high degree
                of disagreement between philosophers, even about this classification. This is not unexpected at all,
                taking into consideration the fact that we cannot be sure about most of the arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Quantum mechanics, a branch of physics which deals with physical phenomena at nanoscopic
                scales, has some important extensions to randomness. Werner Heisenberg, one of the pioneers of quantum
                mechanics, introduced the uncertainty principle, which states that we cannot measure the exact position
                and velocity of a particle at the same time. We could theorize that this means there is true randomness
                in physics and the universe, but we cannot prove the fact that, despite us, humans, even the universe
                does not know the exact measurements of all variables of particles. This debate is part of many,
                regarding quantum mechanics, between Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr. Einstein believed that randomness
                is a reflection of humanity’s inability and ignorance while Bohr claimed it being a universe-level
                fundamental property.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Another argument which exposes this probabilistic nature of quantum mechanical phenomena is the
                Double-slit experiment; which also demonstrates the role of an observer-consciousness, making it one of
                the most absurd and counter­intuitive manifestations of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Certainly, there are definitions for randomness in other science disciplines too. For example,
                computer scientists argue about pseudo-random and cryptographically secure pseudo-random number
                generators. In biology, the diversity of life is attributed to random genetic mutations. In statistics,
                statistically random can refer to a numeric sequence when it contains no recognizable patterns. The
                usage of the concept in these cases adds more complicacy to its definition, as the fundamental notion is
                not clear. Apart from the convoluted saturation of the word, it is also clear how fundamental randomness
                is across all of science.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, many views have been heard since the antiquity on the topic of free will.
                Unfortunately, none of them is convincing enough for the advocates of the other views. The rise of
                quantum physics in the last centuries, though, has had some unexpected consequences on this topic
                because of the theory’s relations to randomness. Hopefully cracking quantum mechanics will also mean the
                unraveling of randomness, determinism, and ideally free will and eventually consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Coming from Node.js: Ruby on Rails and Django</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/coming-from-nodejs-ruby-on-rails-and-django/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;For almost three years now I have been working with Node.js, along with the rest of
                the gang, Express, Mongo, Angular and React.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I had never worked with Ruby on Rails, Django or any other batteries-included web frameworks,
                but I had been always hearing that the pros outweigh the cons in many cases, and especially in a CRUD
                web application. CRUDs did play a major role in the Node.js applications I was working on, so I decided
                to try Rails and Django to see if indeed and particularly how much better they are.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I decided to play with those two since they were the most famous and appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="ruby-on-rails"&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Ruby on Rails was created by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh"&gt;DHH&lt;/a&gt;, the CTO of
                Basecamp (then 37signals) who extracted Rails after working with Ruby on 37signals.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;One of the most surprising features of Rails is the underlying philosophy of &lt;a
                href="http://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/#convention-over-configuration"&gt;Convention over
                Configuration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;For example, if you have a controller method named &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;, then if Rails
                finds an HTML template named &lt;code&gt;new.erb.html&lt;/code&gt; it will automatically render it! It
                is the convention that if there is a template with the same name as the method, in a directory with the
                controller name, it will be rendered.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;That, at first, seemed kind of over the top and scary, but I have grown to really liking it. It
                saves time and lines while not getting in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The next thing that amazed me was the way you can have a model with REST endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Assuming we have a model, &lt;code&gt;Post&lt;/code&gt;, you can just say &lt;code&gt;resources
                :posts&lt;/code&gt; in your routes file and you get all REST endpoints, just like that, one
                line.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In order to do this using Node.js and Express quite a few hours have to be spent. Additionally
                to the hours you need to set up the whole project, file architecture, ORM, routing, testing,
                etc.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The last, of the top 3 things that impressed me is how Rails passes view parameters from the
                controller methods to the template. They just pass every variable defined! You don’t have to create an
                object with the ones you want, Rails sends everything for you, and you can use the one you
                want.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This makes so much sense. If you defined a variable in the controller, 90% you are going to use
                it in the template; there is no need to tweak that object all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Also, separation of development, production and testing environments is done by default, which
                is neat.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The things I didn’t like include the quite complex templating language, especially for forms
                (more details below) and the fact that Rails is very keen on breaking changes. This also makes googling
                very annoying because you don’t know if that specific StackOverflow answer works for 5.X
                version.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="django"&gt;Django&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Django has a similar birth, open sourced after being developed for the website of the Lawrence
                Journal-World newspaper. Its creators are Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;One of Django’s core philosophy, that inherits from Python, is &lt;a
                href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/misc/design-philosophies/#explicit-is-better-than-implicit"&gt;Explicit
                is better than implicit&lt;/a&gt;, which actually is the exact opposite of Rails’ one with convention
                over configuration. Despite all that, one of the things that I like about Django is how much fewer files
                and directories I had in my project than in the case of Rails.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Always using REST models, separate controllers, various namespacing techniques and other
                architecture decisions make Rails grow a large number of files even for a small project. Of course,
                those files are usually much smaller than the Django ones, but I have come to prefer to have, e.g., all
                my forms in one 100-lines &lt;code&gt;forms.py&lt;/code&gt; file instead of 10 separate files, with 10
                lines each, inside a &lt;code&gt;forms&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Django follows this philosophy. One &lt;code&gt;models.py&lt;/code&gt; file, one
                &lt;code&gt;forms.py&lt;/code&gt;, one &lt;code&gt;views.py&lt;/code&gt; file; when a project grows
                large enough you can transition to multiple files.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Since I talked about &lt;code&gt;views.py&lt;/code&gt;, now is a good time to talk about
                naming. Django calls its controllers &lt;code&gt;views&lt;/code&gt; and its views
                &lt;code&gt;templates&lt;/code&gt; (and its models &lt;code&gt;models&lt;/code&gt;). In case you were
                wondering, its “controller” is the framework itself.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;One of the major features of Django is its apps. It is a way to divide a web application into
                parts, and it’s not optional. This frustrated me in the beginning; had I wanted to break my app into
                parts I would go microservices which are more hip.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, I scraped that incarnation and followed &lt;a
                href="https://www.stavros.io/"&gt;Stavros&lt;/a&gt;’ advice (he’s a Django oldtimer) to have a
                &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; app and throw all business logic inside there.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Of the things I liked the most in Django is the way it handles forms. Rails does forms on the
                templates, and the &lt;code&gt;erb&lt;/code&gt; templating language wasn’t the easiest to work with.
                Various confusing tags like &lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;label_tag&lt;/code&gt;, along
                with too much logic made it the most frustrating thing using Rails.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Django’s handling was &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; like a breeze. You can have a
                &lt;code&gt;ModelForm&lt;/code&gt; which automatically creates all input fields for a model, and then
                you can override the things you want. Some were harder to find than others, but once you understand the
                philosophy and the terms (&lt;code&gt;Field&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Widget&lt;/code&gt;, etc) it
                becomes pretty easy.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Another nice thing is that Django has an integrated admin interface in the
                &lt;code&gt;/admin&lt;/code&gt; endpoint of your application. It is pretty useful, I missed it in
                Rails.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;While, as I said, I didn’t like the large number of files and directories in Rails, there were
                some things that I also missed in Django.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Firstly, Django refuses to serve static files in production. It does not have a suitable module
                for doing that, and you either need to install a separate package, &lt;code&gt;whitenoise&lt;/code&gt;,
                or upload and serve static assets directly from a CDN. In my use case though, with dokku (and with
                Heroku) a module to do this would be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This, along with with the fact that Django doesn’t handle by default stuff like separation of
                development/production/testing environments and database url parsing made the deployment a little bit
                more cumbersome than Rails and Node.js, but still pretty easy with dokku.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To conclude with Django, the only thing I’m concerned with is REST endpoints. There is Django
                REST framework but I have not tried it, and I’ve heard it doesn’t have the most straightforward
                documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;All in all, I liked Rails and Django and I’m very interested in working more with them.
                Finally, despite risking oversimplification of any project’s requirements I’d say that I would choose
                Django for CRUDs, and Rails for REST APIs. The shortcuts they provide, respectively for those use cases,
                are awesome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>An anecdotic tour on the history of programming languages</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/an-anecdotic-tour-on-the-history-of-programming-languages/</link>
            <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: The following 2514 words might not be wholly accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, in 1972, the year of the last manned Moon landing, a programming language was
                born:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;C, a general purpose, procedural language was designed by Dennis Ritchie, one of the two Unix
                legends, at Bell Labs (which as of 2016 are a subsidiary of Nokia).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It was named C because it was an improved B, a previous programming language, which was a
                simplified BCPL (hence its name).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;After they wrote C, they decided to re-write Unix to it. This venture was completed steadily
                and in parts.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;During the end of the decade, and in the next one (80s) versions of C were implemented for a
                wide variety of computers, including the IBM PC. This resulted in C becoming ubiquitous and the go-to
                language for systems.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Many people worshipped C. They created religions, cults, sects. Mind control techniques were
                discovered in old journals, and then, it happened.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;An old tomb was discovered in Mesopotamia with its walls covered in C code. How could it be? A
                language for computers written in 1972 being a part of an ancient religion?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Only joking.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But really, many people loved C, like the creator of the Linux kernel, Linus Torvalds. Others
                didn’t like it so much, maybe they felt that something was missing. Such is the case of Bjarne
                Stroustrup, the man behind C++.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Bjarne was into Object Oriented Programming, so one sunny day in 1982 he thought:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Maybe I should create a language like C, but with classes. I’ll name it ‘C with
                Classes’.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;When one year later:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Maybe that was not such a good name. I’ll rename it to C++. Yeah. That’s better.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Linus was not thrilled at all by C++. To be precise, he resented it. Mainly because of lack of
                portability and &lt;em&gt;inefficient abstracted programming models&lt;/em&gt;, as he says.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Five years later, in 1987, Larry Wall started working on Perl and at the end of the year
                version 1.0 was ready. Unfortunately, Larry, like all programmers, was more interested in writing code
                than its documentation, so it took 4 years and the wide adoption of the language for the Camel Book, the
                classic Perl book, to be written.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;At the same year, in Portland, OR, the &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Conference_on_Functional_Programming"&gt;Functional
                Programming Languages and Computer Architecture&lt;/a&gt; (FPCA ’87) conference was held. It was an
                academic conference. One of its outcomes was the participants’ decision that they really like
                &lt;em&gt;Miranda&lt;/em&gt; (a proprietary lazy functional language) and its descendants, and they
                should better create a committee to define an open standard for all these languages.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It took them three years, and in 1990 the &lt;em&gt;Haskell Language and Library
                Committee&lt;/em&gt; announced version 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Due to this history, Haskell is considered an academic language and does not have much adoption
                in the industry. However, there are various companies across the world that do use it.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;One year later, only in 1991, Guido van Rossum released the first version of Python. 🎉. He
                really enjoyed Monty Python, so he thought to use half their name. After all, it’s also a
                snake.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Guido didn’t want to just create a language. He had a vision, and a mantra. &lt;a
                href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/"&gt;The Zen of Python&lt;/a&gt;, as they call it, is the
                core philosophy of the language. It includes abstract comparisons between concepts such as beauty,
                simplicity, and complexity, and it is adored by all Pythoneers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Despite and along with all that, a lot of people came to like Python. It is also very
                multi-paradigm. It is imperative, object-oriented and with multiple Lisp-like functional features. It
                was the first language to put first the intuitiveness of the user in contrast of the underlying
                mechanisms of the compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Four years later, in 1995, NASA’s Galileo Probe entered Jupiter’s atmosphere and the &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytophthora_ramorum"&gt;Sudden Oak Death&lt;/a&gt; (SOD) was first
                reported. &lt;em&gt;Phytophthora ramorum&lt;/em&gt;, the oomycete plant pathogen behind SOD, is the
                reason that many oak populations in California and Oregon died. It is also believed that this organism
                is the cause of a proportionally large number of successful programming languages being created this
                year, both in California and in other areas too.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The spotlight on Java, JavaScript, PHP, and Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Yukihiro Matsumoto was writing mostly Perl and he was happy about it. He was also quite
                intrigued by Python, but with some complaints present:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It seems to me that Python is not a true object oriented language. I’d say it’s an imposter.
                OOP features appear to be some kind of add-on. As if they said, “yeah, throw that inside too”.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It was obvious that Guido wanted to support many paradigms, so object-oriented concepts were
                not top priority in the language design process.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But Matz really believed that OOP is the future, and not one of the features. And thus, Ruby
                was born, with its name, of course, paying homage to Perl.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In Ruby everything is a function call, even arithmetic operations with
                &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;. And thus, parenthesis in function calls are
                in most cases optional.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The above decisions polarized the software community to:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Oh my god! This is so beautiful! I’ll write everything in Ruby now!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Oh my god! This is fucking insane! How could one think of such atrocity?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Features such as &lt;code&gt;5.times { do_this }&lt;/code&gt; contributed to further
                polarization, even in the UK:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Ruby lover: Oh my god! This is so expressive! Even more expressive than Python! I love
                it!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Ruby skeptic: Oh my god! This is bloody mental! Oh, the horror…&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Evidently, apart from successful, 1995 programming languages were also very
                contentious.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It was a fine day of 1995 when Rasmus Lerdorf thought:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Why not extract all those CGIs written in C that I have for my home page in something separate?
                I’ll add web forms integrations and db libs and I’ll call it Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter, or
                just PHP/FI!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In hindsight, it was one of the most controversial ideas of the web. PHP was unique in the
                development speed of a dynamic website, and that made a lot of people choose it even though Rasmus
                didn’t like that his fast hack became one of the most used programming languages. It still lacked good
                design and its independent development resulted in various inconsistencies inside the language.
                Undeniably, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better"&gt;worse is
                better&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Sudden Oak Disease took effect even in large companies, like Sun Microsystems. They somehow
                got the idea that they should create a new &lt;em&gt;write-once run-everywhere&lt;/em&gt; programming
                language. They would do that by creating a virtual machine for all platforms, with a common API. Its
                name: &lt;em&gt;Oak&lt;/em&gt;; named after an oak tree that stood outside its creator’s, James
                Gosling’s, office. This, of course, verifies the theory that the Sudden Oak Disease is accountable for
                the creation and success of the four languages of 1995.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Oak was later renamed to &lt;em&gt;Green&lt;/em&gt; and finally
                &lt;em&gt;Java&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Java follows a classical inheritance object oriented paradigm. This, according to James, was
                not a good idea after all and had he been asked to re-create Java he would throw the inheritance
                hierarchy idea under a tree (probably an Oak) in favor of object delegation.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is quite interesting as it turns out, because the language that does fulfill Java’s dream
                for write-once run-everywhere turned out to be JavaScript, which has object delegation.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;And thus, we reach the final item on the 1995 list. JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;There are many programming languages in this world, and their distribution with respect to
                language design is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"&gt;Gaussian&lt;/a&gt;.
                The majority has a good design; some have somewhat good or somewhat bad design; and very few have an
                outstanding design or a horrifying one. Had you been asked to choose from one of those categories for
                the language that would run to the greatest number of computers ever, which would you pick? As it turns
                out, we did end up beyond three sigma, just not the positive edge. The spread was gradual, few
                noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It was a cold afternoon of 1995, at the Netscape Communications HQ in Mountain View, CA, when
                the company hired Brendan Eich to embed Scheme inside their browser, Netscape Navigator. It was only
                Scheme, a Lisp dialect; what could go wrong? However, as fast a developer as he was, he wasn’t able to
                start working on it until something, well… everything changed.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It took Brendan ten days to create a prototype of a language called &lt;em&gt;Mocha&lt;/em&gt;.
                &lt;em&gt;Another&lt;/em&gt; coffee related word you might think? Might there be an off chance they are
                related? Indeed, Netscape made a deal with Sun Microsystems to include a lightweight scripting Java-like
                language to compete with Microsoft. Mocha seemed an appropriate name. It was a beautiful name, but it
                was deemed as a missed opportunity to advertise Java; so after a brief stint with
                &lt;em&gt;LiveScript&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;JavaScript&lt;/em&gt; was conceived.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Brendan had a vision with Mocha, and JavaScript is influenced by a wide variety of different
                paradigms of languages. Features like first class functions, prototypal inheritance, and event driven
                are what make JavaScript such an interesting language to work with. Furthermore, JavaScript due to its
                quirks and design flaws is a difficult language to master given its simple (yet elusive) features. Some
                say this perpetual challenge motivates them; others stay away while appreciating their lack of
                masochism.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;After 1995 and until the end of the decade not much happened.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Then in 2000, Microsoft decided to create its own Java. The outcome was C#.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Java’s creator James Gosling noticed that and didn’t refrain from giving voice to his
                thoughts&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref"
                href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;C# is sort of Java with reliability, productivity and security deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, C# diverged from Java with its subsequent versions and with the introduction of a
                wide variety of features. It is, also, the main language of the .NET platform, Microsoft’s web
                platform.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;2004 came and Martin Odersky’s resolve to make his vision a blissful reality was being
                accomplished. His dream was to merge the old philosophy of functional programming and the new of object
                orienticism. The result: Scala, a programming language that encapsulates the functional paradigm inside
                object orienticism. Scala has a strong type system like Java, though very concise, unlike Java. It has
                many other connections with it, like the fact that Scala can be compiled to JVM bytecode and also, quite
                predictably, call Java libraries directly from Scala code.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Three years later, in 2007, Rich Hickey, who, like Martin liked the JVM and functional things,
                published his 2½-years&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref"
                href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; work on creating a modern Lisp. &lt;em&gt;Clojure&lt;/em&gt; has
                acquired a following over the last years, and there is a variety of companies that use it on production
                web environments. Along with the implementation for the JVM, there is also ClojureScript, which compiles
                to JavaScript. This means you can write Clojure for the frontend. 🎊.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Then, in 2009, at Google, something of eminent importance happened. Ken Thompson (the second
                Unix legend), Rob Pike, and another person on whom there is no Wikipedia article, Robert Griesemer,
                created Go. These gentlemen were also in the C++ hate club&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a
                class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; because C++’s complexity served as a
                &lt;em&gt;primary&lt;/em&gt; (!) &lt;em&gt;motivation for the initiative&lt;/em&gt;. It is speculated
                that the colloquy at Google at that time was:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Ken: “Oh man, I just hate C++!”&lt;br&gt;
                Rob: “I know. It sucks…”&lt;br&gt;
                Robert: “Hey, let’s create our own language that would be super simple. It won’t have classes. Or
                destructors. Or-”&lt;br&gt;
                Ken: “Or generics!”&lt;br&gt;
                Rob: “Or exceptions!”&lt;br&gt;
                Robert: “Or operator overloading!”&lt;br&gt;
                Ken: “Or inheritance.”&lt;br&gt;
                Rob: “Or malloc.”&lt;br&gt;
                Robert: “Or while.”&lt;br&gt;
                Rob: “Not even while? Neat :wink:”&lt;br&gt;
                Ken: “Or variables!”&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;em&gt;(all three look puzzled)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                Ken continues: “OK, let’s have variables. But we’ll have type inference.”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Go has been widely criticized that it threw some decades of programming experience out of the
                window, and did not include the above — and many other — features. This decision, however, had the
                effect of having a gradual learning curve while over-protecting you from making common
                mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As far as concurrency is concerned, there are two primitives in Go, namely goroutines and
                channels, which implement what is known as &lt;em&gt;Communicating Sequential Processes&lt;/em&gt;, an
                idea first described by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare"&gt;Tony Hoare&lt;/a&gt;
                (the human who invented &lt;em&gt;quicksort&lt;/em&gt;, and other important CS theories). This is
                considered one of the strong points of Go.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;One year later, in 2010, a personal project of Graydon Hoare’s was announced by Mozilla that it
                is being sponsored. The beautifully named &lt;em&gt;Rust&lt;/em&gt; lang was quietly born in 2006 and it
                took only 9 years to reach 1.0, in 2015. Since then, it has been one of the most loved&lt;sup
                id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; programming
                languages.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It is fascinating how much thought has been poured into the design of this language, and
                particularly the design of its type system, its unique feature. Rust is designed to be memory safe. It
                achieves this through concepts such as &lt;em&gt;owned variables&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;borrowed
                pointers&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;variable lifetime management&lt;/em&gt;. In addition, it does not
                support classical inheritance but it has a &lt;em&gt;trait&lt;/em&gt; system, inspired by
                Haskell.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Then in 2011, something exciting happened. Ruby and Erlang had an offspring. It’s called
                &lt;em&gt;Elixir&lt;/em&gt;, and many people think very highly of it.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Before talking about Elixir, though, let’s do a background check on its less known
                procreator.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Erlang is a language from 1986, created at Ericsson, and remaining proprietary until 1998.
                Erlang is not just a language, it’s a cult. People who believe in Erlang have a specific
                worldview&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
                which includes arcane decrees such as &lt;em&gt;Everything is a process&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Error
                handling is non-local&lt;/em&gt;. Joe Armstrong, one of the three inventors, has said:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If Java is ‘write once, run anywhere’, then Erlang is ‘write once, run forever’.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Given that he said this in 2013 can we hold him accountable for Erlang if Java doesn’t turn out
                to be “run everywhere”? 😏&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Erlang has a proven track record of large scale, distributed, high availability web services.
                Furthermore, it has some magnificent characteristics like fault tolerance, hot code swapping, and
                pattern matching. José Valim decided to merge these breathtaking features with some other, friendlier
                ones, along with some Ruby ideas. The result is Elixir.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Elixir is fully compatible with Erlang’s VM, &lt;em&gt;BEAM&lt;/em&gt;. It also provides nice
                tooling, which Erlang does not have, and it has successfully won over people, mainly from the Ruby
                community. Its flagship web framework is &lt;em&gt;Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; which has accumulated rave
                reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Lattner"&gt;Chris Lattner&lt;/a&gt;, the legend
                behind LLVM, while at Apple, invented and led the development of &lt;em&gt;Swift&lt;/em&gt;. It began in
                2010 but it wasn’t until 2014 that we learnt about it. Swift has both influenced and been influenced by
                Rust. It is a compiled language with a strong static type system while it adheres to protocol-oriented
                programming, an idea also known as interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The memory management is done using &lt;em&gt;Automatic Reference Counting&lt;/em&gt; (ARC),
                which includes compile-time memory deallocation decisions, a Rust resemblance. Swift, a year after its
                announcement became open source, which enabled developers to extend it beyond Apple’s interfaces. Its
                use on other domains like the web is rising, as does the adoption from other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The history of programming languages is very interesting to read about. It urges you to make
                predictions for the future. My bet is that Swift, Rust, and Go will win over many domains, with the
                largest one being that of C and C++.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Hopefully, after 45 years, C will pass the scepter and let us prove to ourselves that we now
                know software better.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>The MIU formal system</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/the-miu-formal-system/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;When I started my undergraduate studies on Computer Science I was very enthusiastic
                about the theoretical foundations I was about to learn. In this quest, I googled “best computer science
                books”. This will get you most of the CS classic and among them, you will find &lt;em&gt;&lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach"&gt;Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden
                Braid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a quite peculiar book.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid&lt;/em&gt; (GEB from here on) started as
                a treatise on the proof of Gödel’s &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems#First_incompleteness_theorem"&gt;Incompleteness
                Theorems&lt;/a&gt;, two of the most disruptive theorems in the field of Mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The first one, states that in a &lt;em&gt;formal system&lt;/em&gt; [like Maths] there exist
                truths that can never be proved.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Your response may be “whatever” but try to think it in the following visualization. Imagine
                Maths as a graph, with each node as a theorem.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Mathematicians started out with the obvious truths. Theorems that are well-established and
                obvious are called axioms. For instance, an example axiom: &lt;em&gt;It is possible to draw a straight
                line from any point to any other point&lt;/em&gt; from Euclid’s &lt;em&gt;Elements&lt;/em&gt;. So, using
                these nodes (aka theorems), mathematicians advanced these axioms’ consequences to get to their adjacent
                nodes. Continuing this way, more and more theories were created, more and more theorems were
                discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;So, what the First Incompleteness Theorem says is that there are nodes, that do exist, but you
                can never reach out to them using the consequences of their adjacent nodes. Only by pure luck can you
                discover them. This is amazing. I always considered Maths to be distinctly systematic knowledge, but
                this completely disproves it.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The second theorem takes one step further. It states that if in a formal system [like Maths]
                there is a statement which proves its own consistency, then this system is inconsistent. This
                essentially seals what the first theorem claimed. It's like claiming that you
                &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; lie. If you do, then the statement "I always lie" would be a lie itself.
                Paradox.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Douglas Hofstadter was also astonished by not only the theorems themselves, but also by the
                incredible proofs that Gödel provided. Thus, he started a treatise on that proof. However, Hofstadter
                thanks to his polymath personality discovered that the ideas underlying Gödel’s proof, apart from our
                mind, could also be perceived by our eyes and ears. He presents this to us through the works of Johann
                Sebastian Bach and M. C. Escher respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In this journey, he elaborates on many topics. One of them is formal systems and in this realm,
                he presents a puzzle, the infamous MU puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="the-mu-puzzle"&gt;The MU Puzzle&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Let us assume a formal language MIU. Its alphabet is three letters: &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt;,
                &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;U&lt;/code&gt;. The starting string is
                &lt;code&gt;MI&lt;/code&gt;. Its production rules are:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If you possess a string whose last letter is &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;, you can add on a
                &lt;code&gt;U&lt;/code&gt; at the end. For example, since you start with &lt;code&gt;MI&lt;/code&gt;,
                you can go to &lt;code&gt;MIU&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Suppose you have Mx. Then you may add Mxx to your collection. e.g.: &lt;code&gt;MIU -&amp;gt;
                MIUIU&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;MUM -&amp;gt; MUMUM&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;III&lt;/code&gt; occurs in one of the strings in your collection, you can make a
                new string with &lt;code&gt;U&lt;/code&gt; in place of &lt;code&gt;III&lt;/code&gt;. e.g.:
                &lt;code&gt;UMIIIMU -&amp;gt; UMUMU&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;MIIII -&amp;gt; MIU&lt;/code&gt; (or
                &lt;code&gt;MUI&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;UU&lt;/code&gt; occurs inside one of your strings, you can drop it. e.g.:
                &lt;code&gt;UUU -&amp;gt; U&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;MUUUIII -&amp;gt; MUIII&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ol&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The challenge is to produce the string &lt;code&gt;MU&lt;/code&gt;, or prove it cannot be
                produced.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Nota bene: These are one-way rules. In addition, sometimes, more than one rules may be valid to
                be applied; in this case, you have to pick the best fitting one in order to reach the desired string,
                &lt;code&gt;MU&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;These theories, namely formal systems, grammars, languages, inference rules, etc, belong to the
                domain of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation"&gt;Computation
                Theory&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a very interesting, though deeply theoretical domain of Mathematics and Computer
                Science.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Doubleplusgood Wikipedia</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/doubleplusgood-wikipedia/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;The Wikipedia project is most admirable. It is a single point of reference for a
                colossal amount of topics. Had someone access only to Wikipedia and not the rest of the internet, they
                would still have access to an unprecedented knowledge repository, never witnessed before in human
                history.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The answer to how did we get here is also amazing: crowdsourcing. The vision was that anyone
                could contribute to the initial empty Wikipedia and gradually it would become better than Encyclopædia
                Britannica. Should someone describe a similar concept today, they would have been laughed off. It would
                have been dismissed as impossible and the human nature would have been invoked as an argument. However,
                it was marvelously pulled off.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;So, after all these years reading Wikipedia every day I collected some of my favorite
                entries.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law"&gt;Benford's law&lt;/a&gt;, also
                called the first-digit law. Haven't you noticed that there are more 1s than any other digit in the
                world?&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>The bias of list creation in the form of class methods</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/bias-list-creation-class-methods/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;It's interesting how human biases carry on to writing code and how they evolve in this
                transition.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Recently, at my job, we wanted to create a metrics endpoint. In order to do this task, we
                copy-pasted the controller implementation from the users-list endpoint to the metrics one.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Of course, after using such a technique we had to comb through the users-list code and check
                for possible edits or removal of parts of code that are not useful for the metrics
                functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;However, there is a psychological phenomenon that caused us hours tracking a bug! In this
                phenomenon, given a list and being asked to divide, depending on your way of operation, different sets
                of lists will be created, even with the same comparing function.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To illustrate this, let us assume you have a list and someone asks you to &lt;em&gt;create a
                new list&lt;/em&gt; with the most important items.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;You have two ways of operating:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Create an empty new list and check out every item of the original list. If it is important,
                copy it into the new list.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Duplicate the original list. Check out every item of the new list, and if it not important
                remove it.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If you pick the first way, you will have a shorter &lt;em&gt;important&lt;/em&gt; list than the
                second way. The reason is that on those items that you are torn whether they are important, you will act
                with the default action. In the first case, the default is not copying them to the new list. In the
                second case, the default action is not removing them from the new list.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A way which wouldn't cause a bias is one with no default action. In this case, it would be to
                create two new lists. One is the unimportant items and the other the important ones. Subsequently, there
                is no default aka &lt;em&gt;easier&lt;/em&gt; act; either you write the item in the first list or in the
                second.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This phenomenon applies to the way we wrote the new endpoint controller. Essentially, the
                &lt;em&gt;list&lt;/em&gt; was the list of methods in the controllers and the way we operated was the
                second one, using duplication.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As a result, the new list of methods was larger. The default action of not removing
                code/methods that &lt;em&gt;might be useful later&lt;/em&gt; was followed. One of them was to keep the
                pagination functionality enabled. However, the dummy data set in our local installation was smaller than
                the production one. As a result, it wasn't possible to get new metrics summaries in the production after
                a few, because the request was actually only for page 1. We had to dive through the stack, front, back
                layers and check database durability (&lt;a

            <title>Battlehack Athens 2015</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/battlehack-athens-2015/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;This May I attended for the first time the Battlehack hackathon series. It was also
                the first time they were coming to Athens.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We implemented an &lt;a href="https://github.com/sirodoht/localhero-client/"&gt;Ionic&lt;/a&gt;
                + &lt;a href="https://github.com/sirodoht/localhero-app"&gt;Sails.js&lt;/a&gt; app, which enables you to
                help people of your local community. The idea is to learn and teach people stuff, either for profit or
                voluntarily. The only prerequisite to participate for the winning prize was to use either PayPal or
                Braintree for payments, so we just used it for those who wanted to pay/get paid in the app.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Overall, it was an awesome experience. Braintree (the company behind the organization) had
                prepared everything. Tons of food present at every moment, which does not mean that there weren't also
                separate meals; coffee and red bulls, even massage sessions!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;After the hacking ended we had to present our creation. Although our app decided not to behave
                for these crucial 2 minutes of our pitch, some people, i.e. sponsors, liked us and gave us two gifts for
                using their APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Definitely recommended as an experience, it was very fun and I already plan to attend next
                year. The only regret was not sleeping at all the previous day, which resulted in ~60 hours of
                sleeplessness; at the bucket list of &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to do again!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;P.S. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1jTxVXyDtc"&gt;Highlights

            <title>Advanced language switching</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/advanced-language-switching/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;One field where there is not as much development as I would like is language input,
                other than English. This is understandable for many reasons, but there is so much room for improvement.
                I am Greek and the situation is pretty good, but I cannot imagine how Chinese or Japanese and other
                people with hundred letters in their alphabet, write in their language. I have read there is (or was)
                much debate about how many Japanese letters will be included in the UTF* format.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In Greek, as I said, you can easily setup your keyboard layout in any operating system I have
                seen, but there is none with advanced keyboard layout switching techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="advanced-keyboard-layout-switching-techniques"&gt;Advanced keyboard layout switching
                techniques&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;One very common thing, which always causes time to be lost is that specific fields always take
                English, and never Greek. For instance, the browser URL bar. You are never going to enter Greek
                characters there, so it would be a very good idea to &lt;em&gt;lock&lt;/em&gt; this input field on
                Greek. Of course, this would happen on an OS level, which means that somehow the operating system should
                understand which text input field is active, on any open program.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Of course, the problem starts with the fact that there are not (and can't be) enough letters on
                the keyboard. So, we devise keyboard layout switching mechanisms, that is specific keyboard shortcuts.
                These need to be easy and fast to make. Apple gave the most thought into this matter and assigned
                &lt;code&gt;Cmd+Space&lt;/code&gt;. Microsoft, until Windows 7, had &lt;code&gt;Alt+Shift&lt;/code&gt;
                by default and some other bad choices. Most Linux DEs, following the quantitative mass had assigned
                Windows' &lt;code&gt;Alt+Shift&lt;/code&gt;, but of course you could change it to (almost) anything you
                wanted. Since Windows 8, Microsoft overhauled the language switching widget and introduced, along with
                their old shortcut, &lt;code&gt;Win+Space&lt;/code&gt; too. Since then, I think, some Linux DE's have
                followed.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The last hindrance was configuring &lt;code&gt;Win+Space&lt;/code&gt; on Linux. It was not
                supported out of the box by the X window system utilities, and I did not want to mess with anything else
                or their endless manuals. Thankfully, I found &lt;a
                href="https://github.com/ierton/xkb-switch"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; awesome utility on the ArchWiki, and have
                been content ever since!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="autocorrect-and-prediction"&gt;Autocorrect and prediction&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Another grievance of mine is the fact that there is still no mainstream auto-correct /
                prediction software for language input on desktop systems. SwiftKey is awesome on mobile, why not
                something similar for Skype et al instant messaging applications?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I wonder if those who thought of it, tried it and it didn't work, but sometimes you have to
                type really quickly, and do not care about the mistakes. Maybe next-word prediction is too much, I do
                not use it on my mobile either.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Book: Node.js Blueprints</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/book-review-nodejs-blueprints/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently read &lt;a
                href="http://www.amazon.com/Node-js-Blueprints-Krasimir-Tsonev/dp/1783287330"&gt;Node.js
                Blueprints&lt;/a&gt; by Krasimir Tsonev (Packt Publishing).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It is addressed to people who know JavaScript and want to use it from the server side
                too.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The book starts with a chapter on some programming paradigms that are currently used on the
                Node.js land. Patterns such as inter-module communication or how the asynchronous nature of Node
                works.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The following chapters are mainly concerned with the most important libraries on the Node.js
                ecosystem. The first library the author chose to present us is Express (probably expected). We go
                through a basic site while learning Express. The author, along with every JS library, walks us through a
                tutorial with a sample web application. He continues with chapters on Angular and sample blog, socket.io
                and chat app, backbone and to-do app, ember and social feed app.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Apart from the above libraries, there is material on automation, testing, dynamics CSS, REST
                API, and Node.js desktop apps.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Suitable for those who want a start on Node.js and its ecosystem, Node.js Blueprints is a
                pretty good book. The author's approach with example web apps on each library is very good. Every
                chapter is clear while after finishing it you have learned what you need to start and decide whether you
                want to dive further into.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the code of the book is available from Packt Publishing. Care, though, since there
                are some (understandable) errors.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Recommended!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Short-circuit evaluation</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/short-circuit-evaluation/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Short-circuit evaluation is something that as a junior programmer I did not read about
                but I encountered it in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In C [1] you can do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div style="background: #fdf6e3;"&gt;&lt;pre style=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #859900;"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt; (i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt; j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #657b83;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;// do some
                stuff&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;In this case if &lt;code&gt;i &amp;lt; 10&lt;/code&gt; is false, the C compiler will not care
                to check &lt;code&gt;j &amp;lt; 20&lt;/code&gt; since it has already decided that it will not enter the
                if-statement. This is because there is an AND - &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; operator and
                since the first part was not true, there is no way for the whole to be true. The problem, in this case,
                is that the condition that won't be checked also includes a variable assignment. This means that you may
                expect it to run at least one time, but it won't, since C understands there is no point in wasting time
                to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Of course, after you learn this you can use it to your own ends.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Python also supports short-circuit evaluation (notice the word &lt;em&gt;supports&lt;/em&gt;;
                it is a feature!).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We have something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div style="background: #fdf6e3;"&gt;&lt;pre style=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #859900;"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;large_number&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #859900;"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;is_prime(i):&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;prime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;We have a two-part condition. The first is a division. The second is a function call which
                calculates something with high complexity. If we first check the easy part (short time), we may not have
                to check the hard part (long time) because of short-circuit evaluation. Respectively, if we first check
                the hard part, we may not have to check the easy part &lt;strong&gt;but&lt;/strong&gt; we will already
                have wasted some time.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Of course, that's not always the case. The likelihood of one of the parts evaluating more often
                than the other as true is important. However, this example is enough to demonstrate how we can use
                short-circuit evaluation in our favor.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div style="background: #fdf6e3;"&gt;&lt;pre style=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="color: #859900;"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;large_number&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #93a1a1;"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #2aa198;"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #859900;"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #657b83;"&gt;is_prime(i):&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color: #657b83;"&gt;prime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:
                #93a1a1;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #2aa198;"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;If we didn't have short-circuit evaluation and we wanted to avoid the needless computation of
                &lt;code&gt;is_prime(i)&lt;/code&gt;, we would have to do something like the code above.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;[1] This is true in other languages as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>33 Questions and numeral systems</title>
            <link>https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/33-questions-and-numeral-systems/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/MarkDunne/33-questions"&gt;33 Questions&lt;/a&gt; is a
                GitHub repository with the purpose of coming up with exactly 33 polar questions (yes or no questions)
                which will be able to identify every person living on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Here is its README.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;# 33 Questions&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;There are a little over 7 billion people in the world. That's about 2^33 people.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We could give everybody on the planet a unique series of 33 1s and 0s, and identify anyone by
                their personal series. But that would be boring.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;What if, instead assigning 1s and 0s, we had 33 'Yes' or 'No' general questions that, when
                answered correctly, uniquely identified everyone on the planet. Does this set of questions exist and if
                they do, what are they? The aim of this project is to answer those questions.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The perfect set of questions will be notoriously difficult to produce. Every question will have
                to almost exactly divide the population between 'Yes' and 'No', as well as being completely independent
                of all other questions.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As an example, having both the questions "Are you male?" and "Are you below the median age?"
                will not work because there are more females above the median age than men. Separately they might divide
                the population, but together they will not split the population into 4 group of 25% as
                required.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To contribute to the project, open up a pull request and add your question to the list below.
                All questions are open to debate and discussion.
                The Questions (open to debate)
                * Do you identify yourself as male?
                * Do you currently live in one of the following countries: China, India, The United States, Indonesia,
                Brazil or Pakistan?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="how-they-plan-to-do-it"&gt;How they plan to do it&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;h3 id="short-answer"&gt;Short Answer&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Every answer to those questions is mapped to either 0 or 1 (depending on whether it's a yes or
                a no). Answering all 33 means we have 33 bits, which form a binary number, which will be unique for
                every alive person.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h3 id="long-answer"&gt;Long Answer&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;h4 id="binary"&gt;Binary&lt;/h4&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Firstly, we need to understand binary numbers. We, everyday people, think and operate on a base
                10 (decimal) numeral system. That means, we have 10 unique digits to identify all numbers, from -∞ to
                +∞. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Every number we write is composed only by these 10 symbols. We could
                have other systems, but history decided that base 10 is the best choice since (a) we have 10 fingers
                which we can use to count and (b) it is a balanced number, meaning (i) not there are not many digits to
                learn by heart and (ii) not many digits needed to represent big numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We will explore (i) and (ii) later on. For now, let's focus on how numeral systems
                work.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h4 id="decimal"&gt;Decimal&lt;/h4&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To understand and learn how to count on different systems we need to understand how we count on
                our base 10 system. We learn this skill early on our lives and we do not bother understanding it
                internally (we can't at that time anyhow), so we just learn it intuitively. This is good for learning
                it, but not for understanding it algorithmically, with a cold logic.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Now, let's count!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; 0
                1
                2
                3
                4
                5
                6
                7
                8
                9
                10
                11
                ..
                19
                20
                21
                22
                ..
                98
                99
                100
                101
                102
                ...
                998
                999
                1000
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Notice the way I put each number after another: the units on the rightmost "column", decades on
                the second from the right, the hundreds on the third from the right, and so on. Now pay attention to
                this: we start counting from 1, then 2, continuing 3, 4, ..., until 9. That is where we finish with our
                digits, there are no more, and when this happens we reset our counter and add 1 on the left of the
                number, which means we already have counted 1 decade and we continue from there. So 11 means we have one
                decade, a 10 plus 1.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; 10
                + 1
                ----
                11
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We could write it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; 10
                + 01
                ----
                11
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Here decades and units seem more clearly separated and it is noticeable the fact that at the
                beginning we have 0 decades, which we do not represent explicitly. Every time we max a column we reset
                it and add 1 on the left of it. When we count from 0 to 9 we max the column of units, because we have
                reached 9 which is the last digit. Then we reset it and add 1 on the left, which is incrementing the
                column of decades since we already counted one. The same thing happens when we count from 120 to 129.
                The next number is 130, which is resetting units (0 at the rightmost column) and adding 1 to the next on
                the left (2 becomes 3).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A nice visualization is with old kilometer or miles counters. Each "column" was represented by
                a thin cylinder which had all digits on its circular edge. When we would travel the counting would begin
                and the cylinders would spin, and when there was a full circle and it would reach 0, the next from the
                left cylinder would also be incremented by 1. At the beginning, it was like this, all zeros, and it
                would develop as such:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; 00000
                00001
                00002
                ...
                00010
                00011
                ...
                00019
                00020
                00021
                00022
                ...
                00098
                00099
                00100
                00101
                00102
                ...
                00998
                00999
                01000
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                &lt;h4 id="lets-count-binary"&gt;Let's count binary!&lt;/h4&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Binary (base 2) system has two digits, 0 and 1. We will count binary using the way we count
                decimal with a slight difference: we will not reset when we reach 9 but when we reach the last digit of
                binary, which is 1.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Base 10 2
                0 000000
                1 000001
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Now we have to reset units since we have reached the last digit of our system.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Base 10 2
                0 000000
                1 000001
                2 000010
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Units were reset and the next left column was incremented by 1. Next:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Base 10 2
                0 000000
                1 000001
                2 000010
                3 000011
                4 000100
                5 000101
                6 000110
                7 000111
                8 001000
                9 001001
                10 001010
                11 001011
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Notice that it goes exactly as we said: when a column reaches max it resets and the next from
                the left is incremented by 1.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In base 8 we would count as such:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Base 10 8
                0 000000
                1 000001
                2 000002
                3 000003
                4 000004
                5 000005
                6 000006
                7 000007
                8 000010
                9 000011
                10 000012
                11 000013
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                &lt;h3 id="33-questions"&gt;33 Questions&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Now, to come back to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/MarkDunne/33-questions"&gt;33
                Questions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In order to identify every human on Earth, we need to assign something unique to each one of
                them. The simplest is to assign a number. We need &lt;a
                href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=world+population+2014"&gt;~7 billions&lt;/a&gt; of them. In
                binary, in order to represent the maximum number, we need 33 binary digits. With 32 we can represent
                until 4 294 967 296 numbers/humans, which is a little over 4 billion. That is not enough, so we go to 33
                digits. So, by having 33 polar questions we get 33 answers for each person. We map "no" to 0 and "yes"
                to 1. This gives us a series of 0s and 1s, 33 of them, which we treat as a binary number. Then, we can
                convert this number from base 2 to base 10. The goal is from every person to have a different number,
                which means that the questions must be picked in such a way that no one will answer all 33 questions
                with the same way. The purpose of this GitHub repository is to find those questions, a very difficult
                task!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="complementary-section"&gt;Complementary section&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;h3 id="why-units-decades-and-hundreds"&gt;Why units, decades and hundreds?&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The reason that we have units, decades, hundreds, etc, in our decimal system is because these
                are powers of 10 and we have a base 10 system. Example for 2482.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; 2 4 8 2
                2x10^3 4x10^2 8x10^1 2x10^0
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The columns are 10^3, 10^2, 10^1 and 10^0&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Let's suppose we have a base 8 system. This means that we have 8 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
                7. There the columns would be powers of 8. That is 1, 8, 64, 512, and so on. So for representing 10, we
                would need one from the 8s and 2 from the units, which is: 12.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;So 12 in base 8 is our decimal 10.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;10 in base 8 means that we have 1 from the 8s plus 0 from the units, which is our decimal base
                8.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h3 id="why-10"&gt;Why 10?&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I said that 10 is a balanced number for a numeral system. The balance here is between (i) the
                number of different digits you need to know to make up larger numbers and (ii) the number of digits
                needed to represent large numbers.
                In our case, you need to learn 10 different digits, and then you can represent every number there is. In
                binary system, you need to learn only 2 digits to represent every number. The drawback here is that in
                binary you need many digits to represent large numbers. As we saw, in order to represent the number of 4
                billions in binary you need 32 digits while in decimal you need 10 digits (4 + 9 zeros). The Babylonias
                had a system of base 64! That means they would need to learn 64 different symbols which would be
                isomorphically (one by one) mapped to the 64 digits of the numeral system. What is interesting, though,
                is that it is considered by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6xJfP7-HCc"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt;
                that we should have gone with a base 12 system &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodecimal"&gt;Duodecimal system&lt;/a&gt;, because 12 is a &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_highly_composite_number"&gt;superior highly composite
                number&lt;/a&gt; meaning that it has a higher number of divisors scaled relative to the number itself
                than all other numbers. Also, it is noteworthy the fact that the English language has distinct words
                (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheme"&gt;morphemes&lt;/a&gt;) for the extra digits of a
                base 12 system, that is, for eleven and twelve. We don't call them one-teen and two-teen; but we say
                thir-teen, four-teen, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
